<h2 style="text-align:center;color:#eabd39"><b>William Blake's Biblical Illustrations</b></h2>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">A colleague once came to my office in search of a Bible. When asked how he knew I'd have one, he replied, "Well, you work on Blake."</p>

<p>Blake was steeped in the Bible. While he acknowledged that it was interpreted in different ways&mdash;&#8203;"Both read the Bible day &amp; night / But thou readst black where I read white" (<i>The Everlasting Gospel</i>&#8202;)&mdash;&#8203;he saw it as inspiring rather than prescriptive: "The Whole Bible is filld with Imaginations &amp; Visions from End to End &amp; not with Moral virtues that is the baseness of Plato &amp; the Greeks &amp; all Warriors The Moral Virtues are continual Accusers of Sin &amp; promote Eternal Wars &amp; Domineering over others" (Annotations to Berkeley). He engaged with it in every medium in which he worked.</p>

<p>Blake was famously critical of organized religion, but the contemporaries who acquired his work were of various religious stripes. Thomas Butts, who owned the majority of the works discussed here, had a Methodist heritage; John Linnell, who commissioned <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>, was a Baptist.</p>

<p>The genesis of the exhibition was a <a href="images/exhibits/biblicalillustrations/Biblicalillustrations.pdf" target="_blank">list of Blake's biblical illustrations</a>, ordered by book and verse, that Sheila Spector prepared for her own use. She shared it with the <i>Blake Quarterly</i> around the time that the Archive inaugurated its exhibition wing. Beyond its inherent usefulness, the list was the impetus for this endeavor to provide context for some of the works that illustrate and interpret the Bible. Most of the galleries examine several water color drawings and tempera paintings that coalesce around a theme; one focuses on a single engraving:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Many biographies of William Blake&mdash;&#8203;including the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exhibit/biography" target="_blank">Archive's</a>&mdash;&#8203;point out that Blake was assigned to make drawings of some of the tombs in Westminster Abbey while working as an apprentice to James Basire. Engravings produced from this task were included in Richard Gough's <i>Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain</i> (1786&ndash;&#8203;96).</p>

<p>Blake always held an interest in British history, and echoes of his work at the abbey at the beginning of his career can be seen throughout his later paintings, drawings, engravings, and verse. One of the tombs he drew was that of Eleanor of Castile, a queen who returned "as a subject for the historical print <i>Edward &amp; Elenor</i> [1793] and, much later, for one of [Blake's] <i>Visionary Heads</i> [c. 1819&ndash;&#8203;20]." Edward III&mdash;&#8203;another royal buried in the abbey&mdash;&#8203;"reappears as the protagonist of a dramatic fragment in Blake's first volume of poetry, <i>Poetical Sketches</i> (1783)," as well as in the historical water color <i>Edward III Presenting the Black Prince to the Barons</i> (c. 1793) (see the Archive's <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exhibit/biography" target="_blank">Biography</a>, section 1, par. 9).</p>

<p>Peter Ackroyd makes the claim that this assignment in Westminster Abbey forged a firm link between British history and religion in Blake's mind: "The religious impulses of his childhood were strengthened &hellip; in such a fashion that they became permanently associated with images of history and of art" (54). It is true that, in addition to the secular subject matter of "Edward &amp; Elenor" or <i>Edward III Presenting the Black Prince</i>, many of Blake's works with explicitly religious subjects also reveal influence from the medieval, and specifically Gothic, art he studied in the abbey. To trace some of these echoes, this gallery will examine a selection of Blake's biblical illustrations with an eye to motifs taken from the abbey effigies, wall paintings, and architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">
<li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(1);"><i>Christ in the Sepulchre, Guarded by Angels</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">A caption at the bottom right of the image reads "Exod: CXXV. v 20", directing viewers to the verse "And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be." The verse comes from Moses's journey on Mount Sinai as part of God's instructions to the prophet for building the ark of the covenant. Blake does not directly illustrate the verse, but instead makes an interpretive connection, linking Christ to the mercy seat, the covenant with Moses, and potentially other covenants.</p>

<p>The connection to the ark of the covenant is apt, since Blake's angels do resemble <a href="https://repository.ou.edu/uuid/ca73e79c-3fdb-5021-9709-e09f24619262" target="_blank">representations of the ark in visual art</a>. As Nicholas O. Warner notes, Blake depicts arks or ark-like objects, often linked to the moon, in other works, such as <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/jerusalem.e?descId=jerusalem.e.illbk.44" target="_blank"><i>Jerusalem </i></a> or the much earlier commercial illustration <a href="https://digitalcollections.vicu.utoronto.ca/RS/pages/view.php?ref=13594&amp;k=" target="_blank">"Joshua Passing over Jordan."</a> Benjamin West, then president of the Royal Academy, used the ark as the subject of his 1800 oil painting <a href="https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/30.1971/" target="_blank"><i>Joshua Passing the River Jordan with the Ark of the Covenant</i></a>, five years before Blake is believed to have created <i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i>. Therefore, the subject was a known one for Blake and his contemporaries, and the motif of two guardian angels can be seen in several of Blake's illustrations concerning Christ's tomb and the resurrection.</p>

<p>The positioning of the angels and the corpse of Jesus also reflects another possible influence: medieval tomb effigies. While it is true that laying the dead on their back is fairly common funerary practice across time and cultures, Blake's portrayal especially calls to mind the tombs he observed, drew, and engraved during his time as an apprentice. Scholars have noticed parallels with <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(2);"><i>Countess Aveline, Side View of Her Tomb</i></a> in particular.</p>

<p>In <i>Countess Aveline</i>, we see a trefoil arch, so called because of the three leaf-like shapes that the inner points create. This type of arch is common among the alcoves, wall paintings, and effigies of Westminster Abbey, and is most plainly represented by Blake in <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(3);"><i>The Children of Henry III, Their Tomb</i></a>. Blake uses trefoil arches in a few later works, such as his illustrations to <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/but542" target="_blank">"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity."</a></p>

<p>As Joseph Burke has pointed out in comparing <i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i> to Countess Aveline's tomb, a more abstract version of the trefoil arch is present in the biblical illustration. Anthony Blunt (73) and David Bindman (131) have characterized the shape of the angels as an ogee, but because of the second concave curve formed by the wings, it seems that Burke's pointed trefoil is more accurate. The tips of the angels' wings form the top of the arch, and "the opposing curve of the angels' wings" and their bodies form the foils (Burke 274). As a result, their heads and praying hands become the inner points. In addition, the shape of the door behind the angels gives a faint outline of a basic arch around the trefoils, as in the tomb canopies.</p>

<p>Much as in the drawing of Countess Aveline's tomb, the body of Jesus lies at the feet of the arches. The recumbent position, the long, loose burial garment, and the pillow supporting the head all bear strong similarities to the tomb effigies of Aveline and other nobles and royals in the abbey. All of the Gospels describe Jesus's body as wrapped in linen in the tomb, but none gives more details about the wrappings or garment. Thus, it seems likely that Blake filled in the details with what he observed in Westminster Abbey. One that stands out in particular is the fabric wrapped around Jesus's head, echoing that around the head of Countess Aveline or the mail cowls of some of the warriors in other drawings.</p>

<p><i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i> presents a clear mixture of the biblical and the Gothic. Blake takes a verse describing the ark of the covenant and its angels, then blends it with medieval English architectural and artistic elements he knew well. The result is his visionary version of the effigies he studied in his apprenticeship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(4);"><i>The Death of St. Joseph</i></a></li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(5);"><i>The Death of the Virgin</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">These illustrations, although technically depicting extrabiblical scenes, are included in Blake's biblical water colors. Both contain some of the same tomb effigy motifs seen in <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(1);"><i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i></a>, blending the biblical and the Gothic.</p>

<p>In <i>The Death of St. Joseph</i>, a raised dais occupies the bottom of the image, with a patterned tapestry spread across it and flowing onto the surface below. Joseph lies on the dais, with a blue blanket covering his legs and lower torso. He wears a gown with a hood or cowl, and his hands are clasped in prayer. He looks up to Jesus stooped above him to the left. Mary kneels at Joseph's head. Mary and Jesus cradle Joseph in what is clearly the moment of his death.</p>

<p>The most obvious link to the Westminster effigies is Joseph's recumbent body, again echoing the tomb of Countess Aveline and others. His head rests on a pillow and he wears a similar gown, although it is mostly covered by the blanket. The dais resembles those on the tombs of nobles and royals, and the pattern on the tapestry echoes the floral or geometric designs on some of them, as seen in <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(6);"><i>William de Valence, Side View of His Tomb</i></a> or <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(7);"><i>Richard II and Queen Anne, Side View of Their Tomb</i></a>. The praying hands are another common effigy motif, as seen in the tomb of William de Valence.</p>

<p>Joseph's appearance carries a more subtle link to medieval-inspired imagery when one focuses on his head. He has curly hair and a beard, and unlike <i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i>, the cowl hangs loosely along the sides of his head. The details call to mind depictions of Geoffrey Chaucer, who is almost always shown with a similar beard and cowl. In fact, Blake portrays the poet in a strikingly similar fashion in his <a href="https://manchesteraretgallery-wordpress.j.layershift.co.uk/collections/title/?mag-object-100" target="_blank">heads of poets series</a> and later in both the tempera and the engraved depictions of the <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(8);">Canterbury Pilgrims</a>.</p>

<p>The positioning of Mary and Jesus at Joseph's head also recalls the abbey effigies. Many of the tomb effigies that Blake copied date from the late-thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Lawrence Stone notes that, at this time, small statues of mourners on the sides of the tomb&mdash;&#8203;known as <i>pleurants</i>&mdash;&#8203;and angels supporting the deceased's head were relatively new artistic imports from France (146). Examples of both can be found on the abbey tombs, such as that of <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(9);">Edmund, Earl of Lancaster</a>. In <i>The Death of St. Joseph</i>, Jesus and Mary take the place of the attendant angels supporting Edmund's head.</p>

<p>Finally, the illustration of Joseph's death contains an arch framing the scene&mdash;&#8203;in the sky above the figures, a rainbow filled with cherubim spreads across the image, with beams of light emanating from the Holy Family below. The rainbow is likely an allusion to the covenant between God and Noah. In the context of an effigy-like death scene, however, it also serves as a stylized arch over the tomb.</p>

<p>In <i>The Death of the Virgin</i>, Mary's body, like Joseph's, lies in a recumbent position, clothed in a long, straight funeral gown, again echoing the tomb effigies. She is particularly statuesque, as her eyes appear glazed over and her face is as pale as stone, unlike Joseph, who has open eyes and some color to his face. The slab under Mary is covered with the same patterned tapestry as in the Joseph image, and the rainbow arches over the scene. Two key differences between this work and <i>St. Joseph</i> are the standing middle figure (presumably Christ) and the angels at Mary's head and feet. Christ acts as a large <i>pleurant</i>, mourning his mother, while the angels supporting Mary's head resemble those on the tombs (Bindman 138). The angels also call to mind the <a href="https://repository.ou.edu/uuid/ca73e79c-3fdb-5021-9709-e09f24619262" target="_blank">ark of the covenant engraving</a> mentioned in my discussion of <i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i>; perhaps they allude to the common belief (especially among Catholics) that Mary herself was a new ark of the covenant.</p>

<p><i>The Death of St. Joseph</i> and <i>The Death of the Virgin</i>&mdash;&#8203;both dated 1803&mdash;&#8203;were created nearly thirty years after Blake's assignment in the abbey, but they show the lasting impression that those early apprentice works left on him.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(10);"><i>The Judgment of Solomon</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">This tempera depicts the famous story from 1 Kings 3. With regard to medievalism, Blake's representation of Solomon is perhaps the most important element. Solomon is seen from the front, facing the viewer. He wears a red gown or robe, with a dark blue cloak or cape fastened at his right shoulder and draped over his left arm and shoulder. He is clean shaven, with tightly curled, short hair. Finally, he wears a crown with three <i>fleur-de-lis</i> shaped prongs. When one looks at Blake's drawings and engravings from his Westminster Abbey assignment, this depiction resembles Henry III in particular.</p>

<p>Henry III is represented artistically in a few different places in the abbey, which is fitting, since he ordered the construction of the present building. One monument to him is his tomb, which was among those that Blake drew. As can be seen in the <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(11);">full-body image</a>, Henry is wearing a long gown with an overcloak fastened on his right shoulder. The <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(12);">detail of Henry's head</a> shows a crown with <i>fleur-de-lis</i>, with curly hair framing his face. All of these details reappear in Blake's depiction of Solomon over twenty years later.</p>

<p>Even more striking as a comparison piece to <i>The Judgment of Solomon</i> is <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(13);">Blake's water color</a> of the wall paintings in the <i>sedilia</i> above King Sebert's monument. Both figures wear red robes with dark outer cloaks. Both also have curly hair and wear crowns with three-lobed leaves as prongs, similar in shape to <i>fleur-de-lis</i>. The <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/1780swc?descId=but9.1.wc.01" target="_blank">right figure</a>, identified as Henry III in an inscription (probably not written by Blake), is even more similar to Solomon because he is clean shaven, has slightly shorter hair, and his cloak drapes from his right shoulder down toward and over his left arm.</p>

<p>Blake repeats many of these details in representations of kings throughout his body of work. <i>The Ordeal of Queen Emma</i> (c. 1793) depicts Edward the Confessor in a red gown with blue overcloak, fastened on the right shoulder and draped over the left arm. Bindman (25) argues that this work "stands out amongst Blake's early work for the conscious Gothicizing of the setting and the figures," with its "background of Gothic tracery" and the "rigidity of tomb effigies" in the figures.</p>

<p>The <i>fleur-de-lis</i> crown can be seen in other paintings, such as <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-adoration-of-the-kings-74273" target="_blank"><i>The Adoration of the Kings</i></a> from the same biblical tempera series as <i>The Judgment of Solomon</i>. The rightmost king's crown, curly hair, and short beard resemble the tomb effigy of Henry III in particular. It is difficult to tell for sure, but the miniatures of Solomon and his father, David, in <a style="color:skyblue" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(14);"><i>Epitome of James Hervey's "Meditations among the Tombs"</i></a> appear to wear <i>fleur-de-lis</i> crowns also. In addition, the robes of both figures are red, providing another parallel to <i>The Judgment of Solomon</i>, <i>Queen Emma</i>, and the Sebert <i>sedilia</i>. Thus, the depictions of kings in the effigies and wall paintings of Westminster Abbey greatly influenced Blake's symbolism of kingship, with specific details reappearing in works even late in his career.</p>

Jennifer Davis Michael</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Blake's scenes of the nativity, the Madonna and child, the flight into Egypt, and the presentation in the temple, though incorporating unconventional elements, nonetheless refer to specific biblical events. Of particular interest to me, however, are the apocryphal scenes. What makes these especially engaging is the fact that they fill in parts of Jesus's childhood on which the Gospels are silent, thus furthering a principle we see in Blake's illuminated poetry, where the picture speaks apart from (even at times contrary to) the text. As W. J. T. Mitchell says of "illustrations which do not illustrate" (4), "the absence of direct illustrative function &hellip; allows the picture to be experienced as the focus for an invisible text compounded from a wide range of verbal and visual associations" (8). In such instances, he suggests, we as readers must supply our own "poem"&mdash;&#8203;or, in this case, our own Gospel text.</p>

<p>"Both read the Bible day &amp; night / But thou readst black where I read white": this concluding couplet from <i>The Everlasting Gospel</i> is usually interpreted to mean different ways of reading the text. We might also, however, consider the "white" as the blank spaces that Blake fills in. As Jean-Louis Chrétien puts it, "The white in the margins of the Bible, that emptiness which surrounds the writing, that unsaid which borders and fringes the said, is the place not built but always buildable" (5). Just as the apocryphal infancy gospels and other folklore have filled in the blank spaces of the Gospel narrative, Blake's illustrations of apocryphal scenes call attention to those spaces and invite the reader to join in the work of construction (much as he does in the Preface to <i>Milton</i>).</p>

<p>At the same time, we may consider Christian art as an alternative Scripture: not an inferior medium for teaching the illiterate (as has often been thought), but a tradition with its own language, motifs, and themes (Jensen 3). Certainly, Blake's pictorial corpus has its own such language, but his depictions of the child Jesus also allude to the work of earlier painters.</p>

<p>What we find, then, in this series of apocryphal scenes is a conversation that Blake is having not only with the Gospel narratives but also with the pictorial narratives of his artistic forebears. This conversation is thickened by the interweaving of silence through it all: the <i>Silenzio</i> tradition of the first painting, the silence of the canonical Gospels on Jesus's early childhood, the literal meaning of "infant," and all this in the context of Christ as the Word made flesh.</p>

<p>These scenes also contain hints of the Passion. As Naomi Billingsley points out, "The inclusion of proleptic motifs in images of the infant Christ is not uncommon in Western art" (75). In Blake's hands, these elements call to mind the duality ever present in the fallen world, in which "Joy &amp; Woe are woven fine / A Clothing for the soul divine" ("Auguries of Innocence"), as well as the celestial child who both laughs and weeps as he instructs the piper ("Introduction" to <i>Songs of Innocence</i>).</p>

<p>As noted elsewhere in the Archive, "At some point after 1846, many of the water colors painted for Butts were mounted on backing mats inscribed in handsome script with appropriate passages from the Bible." Consequently, we cannot assume that the titles given are those that Blake, or even Butts, would have chosen (the honorifics for Mary, for instance, seem unlikely). Moreover, some of the connections to Scripture seem strained at best. I address the titles only to emphasize that, at some point, someone felt a need to make these pictures fit the biblical series.</p>

<p>Two other paintings of Jesus's childhood, both temperas c. 1799, are untraced since 1863: <i>Christ with the Doctors in the Temple</i> and <i>The Child Christ Taught by the Virgin to Read</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:yellowgreen" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(15);"><i>The Virgin Hushing the Young Baptist</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Mary is turned mostly toward us, with a book in her right hand and her left index finger raised toward a naked John the Baptist, who is entering from her left. Between them, a naked Jesus lies on his side, asleep, on a bed. Mary's figure, with her head angled to the left, somewhat resembles that labeled "Jerusalem" in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/jerusalem.e?descId=jerusalem.e.illbk.92" target="_blank"><i>Jerusalem</i></a>, while young John has a mischievous expression. John's hands are raised to elbow height, and in his right he is carrying a butterfly. As W. M. Rossetti puts it, John's "face glows with eagerness to show his prize" (Gilchrist 2: 243). The presence of another butterfly outside underscores the sense of freedom.</p>

<p>Many High Renaissance works portray John the Baptist interacting with Mary and Jesus. These include three by Raphael: the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.26.html" target="_blank"><i>Alba Madonna</i></a>, the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/madonna-of-the-goldfinch-raffaello-sanzio/oAFhnMjj7HippQ?hl=en" target="_blank"><i>Madonna del Cardellino</i></a>, and <a href="http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=13850" target="_blank"><i>Madonna with the Blue Diadem</i></a>. Perhaps a more direct influence may be found in Annibale Carracci's <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/404762/the-madonna-and-sleeping-child-with-the-infant-st-john-the-baptist-il-silenzio" target="_blank"><i>The Madonna and Sleeping Child with the Infant St. John the Baptist</i> (<i>Il Silenzio</i>)</a>, purchased by George III in 1766 and now at Hampton Court Palace. Some commentators on this painting suggest that Christ's position on the table, with a shroud-like cloth beneath him, points to his future sacrifice; there are cherries beside him, one of which has been eaten. Mary cradles Jesus with one arm and puts her finger to her lips with the other, while John puts a hand on Jesus's leg.</p>

<p>A Michelangelo version, <i>The Holy Family with the Infant St. John the Baptist</i> (Portland Collection), shows John with his finger on his lips. David Bindman claims that John is "silenc[ing] the Christ Child" (<i>Art and Times</i> 133), although that is by no means clear, as Jesus is already asleep. In this case, Joseph is on the other side of Mary and Jesus, and Jesus is draped on Mary's lap in a way that suggests the <i>Pietà</i>. Blake may have known this drawing through an engraving by Bonasone (Bindman, <i>Blake as an Artist</i> 243).</p>

<p>Blake seems to be both commenting on and correcting the Italian Renaissance tradition of this scene. His Jesus is at the center of the picture; Mary does not come between him and John. On the other hand, he is framed for us by the interaction between Mary's protective stasis and John's exuberant movement. If, as in the earlier <i>Silenzio</i> tradition, there is a prefiguring of the death of Christ, there is also a prefiguring of resurrection in the form of the butterfly carried by John, the cousin who will "prepare the way" for Jesus. Martin Butlin identifies the butterfly as a "traditional reference to death" with reference to the Psyche legend (1: 327). In Blake's work, however, butterflies are powerful and complicated symbols (see Baine, chapter 6). In <i>Night Thoughts</i>, <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but330.1?descId=but330.1.wc.272" target="_blank">Night VII, Contents, p. viii</a>, a kneeling woman inside a blossom reminiscent of "Infant Joy" holds a chrysalis as a butterfly hovers above it. In <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but330.1?descId=but330.1.wc.376" target="_blank">Night VIII, p. 30</a>, an obviously male child with legs spread sits on the edge of a cradle reaching for a butterfly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The figures appear in a natural landscape with a river directly behind them. The curve of Mary's back matches that of the willow branch overhead, reminiscent of the second plate of <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/s-inn.z?descId=s-inn.z.illbk.08" target="_blank">"The Little Black Boy,"</a> which also involves a bent adult figure with two boys and sheep. Mary seems to be supporting Jesus but not holding him, almost guiding him forward, as in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/s-inn.z?descId=s-inn.z.illbk.17" target="_blank">"Spring"</a> (see also <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/songsie.b?descId=songsie.b.illbk.47" target="_blank">"The Fly"</a>). With his left hand Jesus holds onto Mary's arm, while his right points ahead toward John. John is literally ahead of him, "preparing the way," but he is static, standing in <i>contrapposto</i>. With his left hand John feeds grass or grain to the sheep. In his right, he holds a twisted vine, erect, with flowers at the top: Rodney Baine identifies these as honeysuckle wrapped around lily, in place of "John's conventional scepter-like cross" (165). Baine further comments that the color of the scarlet trumpet honeysuckle, which also entwines a tree near John, "suggest[s] the Passion and its name seem[s] to suggest a floral voice" (157). The lily, a traditional flower of paradise, is associated frequently with both Mary and Christ, but Blake appropriates it for the divine humanity, such as in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/songsie.l?descId=songsie.l.illbk.27" target="_blank">"The Divine Image"</a> (Baine 165).</p>

<p>Billingsley suggests that this tempera forms the middle panel of a triptych, beginning with <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/biblicaltemperas?descId=but404.1.pt.01" target="_blank"><i>The Flight into Egypt</i></a> and culminating with <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/christs-entry-into-jerusalem-83204" target="_blank"><i>Christ's Entry into Jerusalem</i></a>, such that "Christ is carried towards his death by three beasts at three stages of his life" (81). Michael Tolley connects it directly with the illustration to <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/s-inn.z?descId=s-inn.z.illbk.10" target="_blank">"The Lamb"</a> (130); indeed, throughout <i>Songs of Innocence</i> Christ is implicitly carried on the lamb as a symbol carries meaning. Another important context for this painting is Blake's <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/letters?descId=lt2oct1800.1.ltr.03" target="_blank">verse letter</a> from Felpham to Butts on 2 October 1800, describing a vision that culminates in Blake being left "as a Child" but also addressed by God as a "Ram," not unrelated to a lamb (Rowland 136). The setting of the painting in a natural landscape also links it to this visionary experience and to the poem's conclusion that "our place in heaven does not have to come at the expense of our place in the world" (Roberts, par. 8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:yellowgreen" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(17);"><i>The Infant Jesus Saying His Prayers: "And the Grace of God Was upon Him"</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The subtitle refers to Luke 2:40: "And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him." Without the subtitle we would not connect the water color to the verse, which does not mention prayer. The scene recalls standard depictions of the nativity, with angels as well as Joseph and Mary showing reverence to the child, and a dazzling light shining on him from above. Only the two hovering angels look directly at Jesus. Rather than passively lying in a manger, Jesus is kneeling on the bed, hands together, eyes turned slightly upward, in an attitude of prayer. He therefore functions not only as an object of worship but also as a model for how to worship. The word "infant" in the title, if taken literally to mean "not speaking," contradicts the idea of "saying prayers" (as in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/s-inn.b?descId=s-inn.b.illbk.05" target="_blank">"Infant Joy,"</a> where a two-day-old child apparently names himself). On the other hand, this infant is himself a Word, and if his prayer is silent, the moment becomes all the more powerful, recalling Meister Eckhart's statement that "God is a Word, a word unspoken" (7).</p>

<p>The words "pray" and "prayer" are relatively rare in Blake's work, one notable exception being the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/laocoon.b?descId=laocoon.b.illbk.01" target="_blank"><i>Laocoön</i></a> plate: "Prayer is the Study of Art." The most extended discussion of prayer occurs in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/s-inn.b?descId=s-inn.b.illbk.17" target="_blank">"The Divine Image,"</a> in which "every man  &hellip; prays to the human form divine." The water color, with the juxtaposition of Jesus's human form and the divine light from above, also calls to mind these lines from <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb126.1?descId=bb126.1.ms.18" target="_blank">"Auguries of Innocence"</a>:</p>

<p>God Appears &amp; God is Light<br />
To those poor Souls who dwell in Night<br />
But does a Human Form Display<br />
To those who Dwell in Realms of day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:yellowgreen" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(18);"><i>The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</i></a> (Butlin no. 410)</li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:yellowgreen" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(19);"><i>The Christ Child Asleep on a Cross</i></a> (Butlin no. 411)</li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">According to Butlin, "This rare subject was sometimes painted in the 17th century, including an example by Guido Reni which was in the Orleans sale held in London in 1798 and was perhaps Blake's inspiration" (1: 328). However, Blake's treatment of the subject is utterly different. <a href="https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/23809" target="_blank">Reni's Jesus</a> is chubby, even voluptuous, with his head propped on his elbow; his body so fills the frame that the cross underneath him is easy to overlook. In Blake's versions, the cross is substantially larger than the child, who lies on it in a position prefiguring the crucifixion (arms outstretched, feet crossed at the ankles, head to one side).</p>

<p>Billingsley notes a print published by Robert Sayer, <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_2010-7081-653" target="_blank">"The Birth of Christ,"</a> in which the newborn Jesus lies in a cruciform position (75n39). The British Museum dates the print between 1752 and 1793. That image lacks both the physical cross and the setting in the carpenter's shop.</p>

<p>In one version (Butlin no. 410), the scene is outdoors. The child is flanked by Mary and Joseph, the latter holding what appear to be compasses or dividers in his right hand, pointing down at Jesus. He is also pointing at Jesus with the index finger of his left hand. The compasses, of course, are a well-known motif in Blake, most famously deployed in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/cpd?descId=but307.1.cprint.01" target="_blank"><i>Newton</i></a> and in the frontispiece to <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/europe.b?descId=europe.b.illbk.01" target="_blank"><i>Europe</i></a>. While it is a normal practice for parents to measure their children's growth, the situation lends the gesture a sinister aspect. Perhaps Joseph, as Jesus's earthly father, is defining him in terms of the material Newtonian universe. Bindman suggests that the compasses "may also signify &hellip; that Christ's sacrifice will be at the hands of Reason" (<i>Blake as an Artist</i> 123). Roses and lilies to the left of the frame, beside Mary, reinforce her presence, as both flowers are traditionally associated with her.</p>

<p>In Butlin no. 411, the composition is largely the same, but Joseph is missing. A partially built wall occupies the immediate background, with openings that display the landscape beyond, including a distant building and the more distant spires of a city. The compasses now lean against the wall. No. 410 has a scrap of cloth under Jesus's legs and a carpenter's square on the floor below the cross; no. 411 has a hammer and some nails on the floor. Mary, who in no. 410 has her head turned slightly to the right, is facing Jesus directly in no. 411, her upper body bent. In both versions, her hands are clasped as though in prayer.</p>

<p>Both versions show a sky whose coloring suggests either sunrise or sunset, in keeping with the duality of Christ's death and resurrection as well as the poignant juxtaposition of youth and mortality. The scene combines the foreboding of the sleeping Christ with the implication that a young boy in the carpenter's shop would naturally encounter a cross. A painting by the Spanish artist Murillo, <a href="https://www.mfab.hu/artworks/the-holy-family-with-the-infant-saint-john" target="_blank"><i>The Holy Family with the Infant St. John</i></a> (c. 1668&ndash;&#8203;70), depicts Jesus and John as boys constructing a cross while Joseph works at a table on one side and Mary sews on the other. Blake's paintings remove the playful element, however, and raise questions as to what Jesus's parents understand about his future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:yellowgreen" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(20);"><i>Christ in the Carpenter's Shop: The Humility of the Saviour</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Along with the title, "The humility of the Saviour," text from Luke 2:51 is included on the mat: "And he went down with them, &amp; came to Nazareth, &amp; was subject unto them." But the Gospel does not mention Joseph's trade at that point. The identification of Joseph as a carpenter comes later, after Jesus's ministry has begun and he is dismissed as a "carpenter's son" when he speaks in the synagogue (Matthew 13:55).</p>

<p>Jesus now appears as an older child or youth, with adult proportions, but considerably shorter than Joseph and Mary, who flank him. Joseph leans on a workbench, legs crossed, with a saw in his right hand. Another tool (a plane?) rests on the bench. Jesus holds a pair of compasses in his right hand and a drafting L-square in his left, each touching the ground. There are lines drawn on the floor. His body faces toward the front, with the left foot forward, as his head turns in Joseph's direction. Mary stands in profile, facing Jesus, arms folded, head somewhat bent. Her figure seems to be in a different plane from the others, more to the foreground and self-enclosed.</p>

<p>Sheila Spector uses the water color as an example of the need to consider esoteric interpretations of Blake's work. She focuses on the latter part of Luke 2:51, "but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart." Spector reads Christ as the central column between the masculine (divine wisdom) and feminine (human intelligence), and the workshop as the World of Fact in which restoration is to begin (22).</p>

<p>Other critics have tended to focus on the meaning of the compasses. John Grant says Jesus "handles [the compasses] with impunity" (334)&mdash;&#8203;the implication being that in the hands of anyone but Jesus, the compasses are a dangerous tool. See also <i>Night Thoughts</i>, <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but330.1?descId=but330.1.wc.360" target="_blank">Night VIII, p. 14</a>, in which a teacher is drawing with compasses and a young man studies his drawings on the floor. Perhaps this is why Bindman sees Jesus as "demonstrating [the compasses'] use to his parents" (<i>Blake as an Artist</i> 123), although Joseph might just as well be giving instruction to Jesus. Leslie Houlden (1: 94) and Morton Paley (56) both suggest that the compasses' appearance here indicates the integration of reason with imagination or spiritual vision. On the other hand, John Gage emphasizes the divisive function of compasses (also known as dividers): "The man Jesus recurs often in [Blake's] prophecies as a symbol of division, and hence, according to Blake's doctrine of generation, of the material world" (376).</p>

<p>One element that seems to have gone unnoticed is the mirroring of form between the compasses and the legs of Jesus. A similar comparison is often noted between the frontispiece to <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/europe.b?descId=europe.b.illbk.01" target="_blank"><i>Europe</i></a> and <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/esvii.1-1b?descId=esvii.1-1b.spb.01" target="_blank"><i>Albion rose</i></a>: Mitchell, for example, suggests that Albion breaks the boundaries that Urizen imposes (56). While Jesus in <i>Christ in the Carpenter's Shop</i> does not have his arms extended as Albion does, the position of his left leg mirrors the asymmetry often noted in <i>Albion rose</i>. Furthermore, the compasses, being held at an angle, are both asymmetrical (unlike those in <i>Europe</i>) and mirror the stance of Jesus's legs, both in degree and in length. His hand, where the dividers are joined, is level with his crotch, where his legs are joined. This is also, of course, the location of the generative organs. As one who connects in his own body the world of Generation to that of Eternity, Jesus thus becomes a living model for human scale and imaginative design in the building of Jerusalem.</p>

Naomi Billingsley</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">This gallery explores eight pictures that depict the public ministry of Jesus from the tempera and water color series of biblical designs for Thomas Butts.</p>

<p>Jesus is an important figure in Blake's thought, appearing in various aliases from early works such as <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/aro" target="_blank"><i>All Religions are One</i></a> (c. 1788) to late writings such as the so-called <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/laocoon" target="_blank"><i>Laocoön</i></a> plate (c. 1826&ndash;&#8203;27), and in images both commissioned and speculative throughout Blake's career.</p>

<p>I have argued elsewhere that Blake's images of Christ are a vehicle for his ideas about art and religion. My perspective here is slightly different, as I focus more directly on how the designs examined respond to the biblical text. I therefore refer to the biblical Jesus rather than the Christ of religious thought.</p>

<p>Blake is attentive to the biblical text, but sometimes innovates from, expands upon, or emphasizes details in the narrative for visual or exegetical interest.</p>

<p>The narratives represented in these images go some way to demonstrating why Jesus was such an important figure for Blake: he built communities, he rejected the fakery of Satan, he questioned the Law, he emphasized the power of the faith of the individual. All of these traits resonate with key principles in Blake's thought.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(21);"><i>The Baptism of Christ</i></a> (tempera)</li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(22);"><i>The Baptism of Christ</i></a> (water color)</li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Jesus's baptism marks the start of his public ministry in the Gospels of Matthew (3:13-17), Mark (1:9-13), and Luke (3:21-22). This subject is one of a handful of biblical narratives that appear in both the tempera and water color designs for Butts, and Blake would later depict the event in his water color designs for John Milton's <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but544.1?descId=but544.1.wc.01" target="_blank"><i>Paradise Regained</i></a> (c.1816&ndash;&#8203;20).</p>

<p>The two versions are similar in composition, centering on the waters of the River Jordan, which flows into (or out of) the viewer's space and winds between hilly outcrops in the background. Jesus and John the Baptist are center foreground, flanked by other figures, presumably believers who went to John to be baptized. A host of angels in a blaze of light look down from the sky, and a dove descends toward Jesus from their midst (Matthew 3:16, Mark 1:10, Luke 3:22, John 1:32).</p>

<p>In the tempera, Jesus faces the viewer, with the Baptist to the left in the composition, facing into the picture. In the water color, Jesus faces into the picture, slightly turned to the right so that his face is visible in profile, while the Baptist stands to the right and is seen in left profile. The position of John in the tempera and Jesus in the water color facing into the picture may act as an invitation to viewers to envisage themselves as part of the scene&mdash;&#8203;to follow them into the River Jordan.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant difference is the behavior of the flanking figures. All three accounts of the event refer to other people who had come to John to be baptized (Matthew 3:5-6, Mark 1:4-5, Luke 3:7-18). In the tempera, the figures respond in a variety of ways: some kneel before Jesus, one stands with a bowed head and hands together in prayer, and some&mdash;&#8203;two of whom are children who also have their hands raised in gestures of exaltation&mdash;&#8203;look up at the angelic host. In the water color, one figure turned away from the viewer looks up at the angelic host, while the rest kneel before Jesus.</p>

<p>As the inauguration of Jesus's public ministry, this scene represents the start of his work of building a community of believers. The exultant children in the tempera may represent the most Blakean reaction to the event. Blake celebrated childlike vision in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/songsie" target="_blank"><i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i></a> (1789, 1794) and told Rev. Dr. Trusler in his <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/letters?descId=lt23aug1799.1.ltr.03" target="_blank">letter of 23 August 1799</a> that children were astute viewers of his pictures.</p>

<p>It is not known how the Butts displayed their Blake pictures, but it is possible that some were exhibited in the school run by Mrs. Butts (Viscomi 15). If that was the case, the young students might have identified with the children in the tempera.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(23);"><i>The Third Temptation</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><i>The Third Temptation</i> immediately follows <i>The Baptism of Christ</i> in the biblical sequence of Butts water colors, although it was probably created slightly later.</p>

<p>Following his first public appearance at his baptism, Jesus has a period of self-discovery in the wilderness, where he is subjected to a series of temptations (Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, Luke 4:1-13). The individual temptations are narrated in Matthew and Luke, but their accounts differ on the order. <i>The Third Temptation</i> depicts the final test in Matthew (4:8-10), where Satan takes Jesus to a mountain and offers him all the kingdoms of the world.</p>

<p>While <i>The Baptism</i> depicts a community of believers coming together centering on Jesus, <i>The Third Temptation</i> shows Jesus rejecting the figure of Satan, who seeks to challenge that community of belief.</p>

<p>Jesus stands on a precarious rocky outcrop, his pose strong but almost impassive. He shows no anguish in facing the temptation, and simply looks down calmly at the falling figure of Satan, curled up into a ball. As I have argued elsewhere, this arrangement may be a visual play on Satan's words: "All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me" (Matthew 4:9). Matthew simply states that Satan leaves Jesus (4:11), so Blake's depiction of the tempter falling in a kneeling position seems to turn Satan's words against him (Billingsley 97-98).</p>

<p>This image shows Jesus rejecting the fakery of Satan and ready to begin his public ministry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(24);"><i>Christ Baptizing</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">While most of the pictures in this gallery could be described as illustrations to the Bible, this design is a more allegorical depiction of a biblical event. It represents John 3:22: "After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized." There is no narrative detail that explains how many or who the people were, where the baptisms were performed (in the river?), and so on. Blake has taken this verse and conceived a design that is stretching the definition of biblical.</p>

<p>He sets the scene anachronistically in a church-like interior, with a font for baptism. The people gathered represent all ages, from infants to the elderly. Jesus cradles an infant in his left arm and holds his right hand over the font.</p>

<p>Above his head a dove descends, recalling the dove that appeared at his own baptism, which is described in the Gospels as a physical manifestation of the Holy Spirit. By depicting a dove at the baptism of believers here, Blake creates a visual and conceptual link between this picture and <i>The Baptism of Christ</i>. It implies that the baptisms are of the same kind: the believers are receiving the same Holy Spirit that descended on Jesus himself.</p>

<p>As in the tempera version of <a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(21);"><i>The Baptism</i></a>, children are prominent among the gathering of believers in this image. They are physically closer to Jesus than the adults, and two flank the font, holding hands in front of it so that they are visually in harmony with its design. They, it seems, are not merely recipients of, but also participants in, Jesus's ministry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(25);"><i>The Woman Taken in Adultery</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The narrative depicted (John 8:1-11) is one of several in the Gospels about altercations between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees. Here, they bring a woman accused of adultery to him. According to the Law, the punishment for this crime is stoning, and they test Jesus by asking him what he thinks. Initially he ignores them, stooping down to write on the ground, but when pressed, he responds "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John 8:7) before returning to his writing on the ground. The accusers leave one by one.</p>

<p>It is this moment in the narrative&mdash;&#8203;when the elders depart and Jesus writes in the ground a second time&mdash;&#8203;that Blake selects to depict. As Christopher Heppner has discussed, Blake's focus here is unorthodox because it shows Jesus in a stooped position and therefore ignores the principle of representing him as "the principal actor, and in a dignified posture" (Heppner 47).</p>

<p>While plenty of artists have ventured to depict this frame in the story, two points are distinctive about Blake's Jesus. First, as Heppner notes, he bends from the waist to write, which is not a comfortable pose to hold, but makes him an athletic figure (50). Second, as Christopher Rowland points out, the arrangement of figures places Jesus bowing before the woman (181-82).</p>

<p>The woman is shown with a bare breast and disheveled hair. In many depictions of this subject, she is attempting to cover herself up, but in Blake's version she has her hands tied, making her helpless. She is a victim of the Law.</p>

<p>This narrative resonates with Blake's condemnation of hypocrisy and legalism: Jesus shows the law-keepers that their rules are hypocritical. These accusers flee the scene, and Blake depicts them as a faceless mass, relegated to the back of the picture. Jesus and the woman are the protagonists: the liberator bowing before the accused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(26);"><i>Christ Giving Sight to Bartimaeus</i></a></li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(27);"><i>Christ Raising Jairus's Daughter</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">These two tempera paintings depict episodes from Jesus's healing ministry.</p>

<p>Biblical painting had been relatively scarce in Britain since the Reformation, but began to reemerge from the mid-eighteenth century as part of an effort in the British art world to establish a native school of history (that is, narrative) painting. Within this genre, Jesus's healing miracles were among the more popular subjects, probably because they contain a strong moral message.</p>

<p>At the same time, in the wake of the Enlightenment there was extensive philosophical disputation about the nature of miracles. Blake engaged with this debate in his annotations to Richard Watson's <i>Apology for the Bible</i> (1796), which was a response to Thomas Paine's critique of the "fabulous theology" of institutional Christianity, including Paine's rejection of miracles.</p>

<p>Commenting on Watson's discussion of miracles, Blake writes:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">Jesus could not do miracles where unbelief hinderd &hellip;. The manner of a miracle being performd is in modern times considerd as an arbitrary command of the agent upon the patient but this is an impossibility not a miracle neither did Jesus ever do such a miracle. (Erdman 616-17)</p>

<p>In other words, the miracle for Blake is not an external act by Jesus, but an internal process realized by the patient. The Gospels themselves refer to Jesus emphasizing the importance of the faith of his patients for their healing.</p>

<p>Of the several accounts of Jesus healing the blind in the Gospels, the healing of Bartimaeus in Mark 10:46-52 is particularly resonant with Blake's understanding of miracles. While other accounts refer to Jesus touching or putting spittle on patients' eyes (Matthew 20:29-34, Mark 8:22-26, John 9:1-12), in the Bartimaeus story (and in Luke 18:35-43) Jesus simply tells the patient that his faith has healed him.</p>

<p>The subject is relatively unusual, artists seeming to favor the narratives where Jesus touches his blind patients' eyes, but Blake makes the most of another detail in the narrative for visual interest: Bartimaeus casting his cloak aside.</p>

<p>In both <i>Bartimaeus</i> and <i>Jairus's Daughter</i> there is dynamic interaction between Jesus and his patient. Blake is attentive to biblical details in both pictures. While in <i>Bartimaeus</i> there is no physical contact between Jesus and his patient, in <i>Jairus's Daughter</i> Blake follows all three accounts of this narrative in depicting Jesus taking the girl by the hand (Matthew 9:18-26, Mark 5:21-43, Luke 8:40-56). While the biblical narratives of the raising of the girl emphasize the faith of her father, Blake focuses on the interaction between Jesus and the girl: their gaze as well as their joined hands. But Jesus's other outstretched hand forms an arc that reaches toward the girl's parents, thus enfolding them in the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:violet" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(28);"><i>The Hymn of Christ and the Apostles</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The subject of this water color is taken from a verse that appears in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark. At the end of their accounts of the Last Supper (a subject Blake depicts in a <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/biblicaltemperas?descId=but424.1.pt.01" target="_blank">tempera painting</a> for Butts), they state of Jesus and his disciples: "And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives" (Matthew 26:30, Mark 14:26).</p>

<p>This fleeting reference to the singing of a hymn is a highly unusual subject in art. I have not identified any precedents of this as a standalone subject, but it does appear in composite images of the events leading to Jesus's death. The very choice of subject here is innovative and could reflect the interests of both artist and patron.</p>

<p>As Mary Lynn Johnson has discussed, Butts's father, Thomas Butts, Sr., had compiled the Methodist hymnbook <i>Harmonia-Sacra</i> (c. 1753), making the subject of Jesus and his disciples singing a hymn appropriate for the patron ("Newfound Particulars" n2). Blake himself may have been exposed to the strong Moravian culture of hymn singing by his mother (see Davies and Schuchard). The subject probably also appealed to the artist as one that places Jesus and his disciples in an act of creative expression.</p>

<p>The references in Matthew and Mark imply that the hymn was sung in the room where the Last Supper took place, and then Jesus and his disciples went to the Mount of Olives. Blake plays with this chronology, depicting the event taking place outside&mdash;&#8203;presumably on the Mount of Olives. While the Bible has this as a private moment shared by Jesus and his disciples, Blake's relocation of the act makes it public.</p>

<p>As Johnson has discussed, Blake's company of disciples is more inclusive than the traditional title <i>The Hymn of Christ and the Apostles</i> suggests. The apostles were the twelve male principal disciples of Jesus, but Blake's group includes two women, perhaps Martha and Mary of Bethany ("Blake's Mary and Martha" 100-01). The biblical text allows for the presence of the women, stating that the twelve were at the Last Supper, but not explicitly stating that no others were present.</p>

<p>Jesus is seen here as the center of a creative community. Alighting on this subject that only fleetingly appears in the Bible, Blake finds a fitting subject for the conclusion of Jesus's public ministry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">There are many works where we could wish for more evidence of Blake's materials and processes; relatively speaking, his set of engravings illustrating the story of Job is not one of them. Preliminary sketches, copperplates, and several groups of prepublication proofs all survive. The proofs allow us to follow the evolution of a plate through its various states, or stages of execution.</p>

<p>The <a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(29);">plate numbered 13</a> depicts Job 38, where God finally reveals himself to Job and poses a number of questions that emphasize the futility of trying to rationalize existence. Blake has inscribed in the margins below and above the central image the two opening verses&mdash;&#8203;the appearance and a rebuke:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">Then the Lord answered Job out of the Whirlwind<br />
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge<br /></p>

<p>The two plates that follow, <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb421.1?descId=bb421.1.spb.16" target="_blank">"When the Morning Stars Sang Together"</a> and <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb421.1?descId=bb421.1.spb.17" target="_blank">"Behemoth and Leviathan,"</a> also illustrate God's words in Job 38-41.</p>

<p>The engraving is based on the <a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(30);">water color</a> of the scene from the set that Blake painted for John Linnell in 1821, in turn based on the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but550.1?descId=but550.1.wc.13" target="_blank">Butts version</a> of 1805&ndash;&#8203;06. Linnell <a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(31);">commissioned</a> the engravings in 1823. As with other designs for this series, Blake made a <a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(32);">sketch</a> preliminary to engraving. A few of the drawings&mdash;&#8203;notably the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but557.1?descId=but557.1.penc.09" target="_blank">sketch for the plate numbered 3</a>&mdash;&#8203;have rough indications of border designs, although they don't match the engraved versions. Their presence seems at odds with Linnell's later statement that the border decorations were an eleventh-hour addition: "The Borders were an afterthought and designed as well as engraved upon the Copper without a previous Drawing" (letter to Charles Dilke, 1844).</p>

<p>As noted in the postscript to the memorandum of agreement, the procurement of the copperplates was Linnell's responsibility. The majority of the plates, including plate 13, bear the mark of the firm of Pontifex and Co. on the verso; Linnell's account books record the purchase on 2 May 1823. For this project, Blake used line engraving, a technique considered old fashioned by the standards of the day (see the Archive's <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exhibit/illuminatedprinting" target="_blank">Illuminated Printing</a> exhibition, section 1, "Engraving").</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(33);">Prepublication state 1</a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">There are five known prepublication states of plate 13; other plates vary from one (the title page) to ten (plate numbered 11). In this gallery I focus on the development of the central feature, the whirlwind (for more complete accounts of the changes between states, see Sung, "New Information," and Essick).</p>

<p>The first state has a central design enclosed by a single line. Note the much greater contrast between light and dark in the engraving, compared with the <a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(30);">Linnell water color</a>. God, whose questions concern forces of nature unfathomable to humans, arrives in just such a phenomenon. The whirlwind, which in the Linnell water color is largely behind the figures in the foreground, and even more in the background in the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but550.1?descId=but550.1.wc.13" target="_blank">Butts version</a>, here envelops them all. Its effect is more psychological than physical, but, as a concession to its power, tufts of Job's hair now stick out at the back of his head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(34);">Prepublication state 2</a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The most noticeable addition is the border, separated from the central design by a second framing line. Practically, it encases the central image, no matter the orientation of the image, in a container of a uniform shape. Artistically, it mirrors the central design, with heaven/&#8203;dynamism above (God-like figures that are both in and of the wind) and earth/&#8203;stasis below (trees whose bowed forms echo the figures of Job's friends). Earlier in the biblical text Job has compared himself to a felled tree: "He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree" (Job 19:10). In addition, the border designs advance the narrative, illustrating the forces of nature in the questions inscribed by Blake: "Who maketh the Clouds his Chariot &amp; walketh on the Wings of the Wind" (Psalm 104:3), "Hath the Rain a Father &amp; who hath begotten the Drops of the Dew" (Job 38:28).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(35);">Prepublication state 3</a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">In the previous state, a few curved lines just above the outer frame hint at an extension of the whirlwind into the border. Here, all heaven breaks loose as the whirlwind blows through its bounding lines to erase the distinction between central design and border. <a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.4853.html" target="_blank">Prepublication state 4 of the plate numbered 16</a> also breaks that barrier with a heavenly expression of power, the mandorla around God. In the biblical text Job has lamented, "He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths" (Job 19:8). In Blake's engraving, the lines surrounding the central design have acted as a barrier of his own making for the man who has been dutifully observant but not spiritually alive. The vision of God opens up, literally and figuratively in this state, a new relationship to the divine: "I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee" (Job 42:5, inscribed on <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb421.1?descId=bb421.1.spb.19" target="_blank">plate numbered 17</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(36);">Prepublication state 4</a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Though remnants of the whirlwind remain in the upper border and one line reaches down through the framing lines to the left, the central design is separate again. The same clearing occurs in the next state of plate 16. It's impossible to know whether this was Blake's decision or Linnell's. The set of prepublication proofs to which the second state of plate 13 belongs was first recorded in detail fairly recently, by Mei-Ying Sung. As she says,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">It appears that Blake at first created the more restrained whirlwind, then dramatically extended it, then restrained it again in all later states. The evidence of [state 2] shows Blake's shift of mind in the most remarkable way: without it, the logical&mdash;&#8203;but wrong&mdash;&#8203;assumption would be that Blake "began" with the exuberant whirlwind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orange" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(37);">Prepublication state 5</a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">In the fifth state Blake has cleared both the last line of the whirlwind within the frame and almost all vestiges in the space above the outer framing line and below the outline of the cloud. He has added the imprint and "Proof" inscription; the signature and plate number first appear in state 2. State 5 is extremely close to the published version. There are two published states from 1826: one retaining the "Proof" inscription and one with it removed.</p>

Sheila A. Spector</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The field of Western esotericism is predicated on four intrinsic characteristics: universal correspondences; living nature; mediation and the imagination; and transmutation (see Faivre 12). Together, these characteristics consolidate into a unique symbolic form revolving around a cycle of fragmentation and restoration, exile and return. The symbolic form was fleshed out by the kabbalistic myth, which was subsequently Christianized into a cycle with four phases:</p>

<p>1. Primordial Institution. Kabbalists believe that the godhead, the active form of the divinity, emanated a series of ten divine lights (Hebrew <i>Sefirot</i>, pl., <i>Sefirah</i>, sing.), which were to perform the work of creation. The most influential visualization of the lights is the <a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(38);"><i>Sefirotic</i> Tree</a>. Consistent with the concept of correspondences, the tree was associated with all aspects of creation, including the <a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(39);">human body</a>. Horizontally, the tree corresponds to four cosmic planes: at the top the World of Emanation, corresponding to the godhead's original idea to create (the divine idea) and governed by the Immortal Soul; the World of Prototypical Creation, where the idea is actualized on the spiritual plane by the Spiritual Soul; the World of Archetypal Formation, where the idea is given form by the Rational Soul; and the World of Fact, where the form is implemented by the Animal Soul. All four were originally intended to be purely spiritual. Vertically, the tree reflects cosmic balance: right and left correspond to male and female, pity and wrath. The extremes are balanced by the mediating Central Column.</p>

<p>2. State of Destitution. The godhead enclosed each light in a vessel made of dross. The fifth <i>Sefirah</i>&mdash;&#8203;represented in the <a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(38);">first illustration</a> by <i>Gevurah</i> (strength), though in others by <i>Din</i> (judgment)&mdash;&#8203;overestimating its own prowess, drew all of the other lights into its vessel, which shattered and released negation into the cosmos. Some of the lights remained pure and were able to rise; others were contaminated and drawn down by the shards. As a result, a cosmic crisis occurred. Although the highest plane, the World of Emanation, remained unaffected, the other three, known collectively as the World of Separation, were each lowered a degree, and the World of Fact became corporeal. According to the esoteric interpretation of Genesis, had the biblical Adam resisted temptation, the cosmos would have reverted to its originally intended state. Because he succumbed, the entire cycle must be experienced.</p>

<p>3. Modern Constitution. This phase represents the historical expanse between the expulsion from Eden and the apocalypse. <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, as manifestation of the Saviour, and <i>Adam Rishon</i>, created man, must each strive to correct the primordial error so that cosmic unity can be restored. On the macrocosmic level, <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is to separate out the shards of negation so that the lights of purity can rise again. Microcosmically, <i>Adam Rishon</i> is to purify the soul by fulfilling the biblical commandments.</p>

<p>4. Supreme Restitution. When all of the lights have been separated and the souls purified, <i>Adam Kadmon</i> will be reunited with the <i>Shekhinah</i>, the female symbol of immanence; the World of Separation will reunite with the World of Emanation; and cosmic unity will be restored.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#cbcbcb; margin-top: 30px">Blake's Anagogy</h3>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(40);"><i>An Allegory of the Bible</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Traditionally, <i>An Allegory of the Bible</i> is read as an indicator of Blake's conflicted attitude toward the Bible (Rowland 231). Through an esoteric lens, the picture can be seen as a representation of the four planes of the cosmos. At the bottom, the woman and child in street clothes cross the threshold of the World of Fact. They are greeted by the woman in a gauzy red dress in the World of Archetypal Formation, who ushers them to the World of Prototypical Creation, represented by the groups of diaphanous figures examining the books on their laps. Some turn away from the text, seeking inspiration from the highest level, the outline of a book swathed in light. From this perspective, the railing that extends across the picture constitutes a barrier that isolates those in the World of Separation from the highest plane.</p>

<p>Key to transforming the barrier into a bridge is the esoteric interpretation of Christianity. In <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb122.1?descId=bb122.1.ms.72" target="_blank">"A Vision of the Last Judgment,"</a> Blake associates empirical knowledge with the impediment that obstructs "the Vision of God turning all into a Consuming fire." To counter reason, it is necessary to seek <i>Da'at</i>, the kind of knowledge that includes "Imaginative Art &amp; Science &amp; all Intellectual Gifts all the Gifts of the Holy Ghost." This knowledge is predicated not on the material laws, but on the esoteric characteristics that produce a completely different mode of thought. Blake used the biblical illustrations to correct what he viewed as the exoteric misperception, especially as based on biblical typology, the assumption that figures and events in the Old Testament foreshadow those of the New.</p>

<p>Blake relates the Old Testament to the World of Separation, the three planes that have lost their direct connection with the divine idea. He presents the New in terms of esoteric Christianity, an understanding derived from <i>Da'at</i>, the knowledge through which those in the World of Fact can gain access to the World of Emanation, governed by the Immortal Soul. To visualize the shift in orientation, in many of the pictures he replaces the conventional cross with the <i>Sefirotic</i> Tree as the formal basis for presenting the esoteric characteristics that underlie knowledge.</p>

<p>The following discussion revolves around five groups of illustrations from the Old and New Testaments. The first demonstrates how knowledge constitutes the bridge connecting those in the World of Separation with the divine idea. The other four demonstrate how Blake's view of Christianity is predicated on the intrinsic characteristics of Western esotericism.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#cbcbcb; margin-top: 30px">Blake's Esoteric Knowledge</a></h3>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(41);"><i>The Judgment of Solomon</i></a></li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(42);"><i>The Last Supper: "Verily I Say unto You That One of You Shall Betray Me"</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">From the Old Testament, <i>The Judgment of Solomon</i> is based on 1 Kings 3:16-28. Conventionally, the picture is read as a critique of man's hubris. In <i>Blake as an Artist</i>, David Bindman claims that Solomon's</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">act of justice is probably meant to be seen not as an act of superior wisdom, but as a usurpation by a mortal of Divine justice. On other occasions in Blake's visual work, Solomon is depicted with a pair of compasses, a Blakean symbol of materialism, but in the case of Solomon it refers more precisely to Hebrew legalism, or worship of the letter over the spirit. (120)</p>

<p>From the esoteric perspective, Solomon can be seen as doing the best that he can with the tools that he has. He exists spacially in the World of Separation and temporally before the birth of Christ, so his contact with the World of Emanation has been severed. Therefore, he relies on empirical reasoning as the basis for his judgment. It should be noted that the process does enable him to reunite the child with its real mother.</p>

<p>The New Testament counterpart, <i>The Last Supper: "Verily I Say unto You That One of You Shall Betray Me,"</i> is from Matthew 26:20-25. As Martin Butlin notes, Blake's version depicts Judas, in the lower-right corner, counting his money, though "it is implied in the Gospels that he was not paid until after the Betrayal" (1: 332).</p>

<p>The picture models <i>The Judgment of Solomon</i>. Both are triangular, with the main figure seated at the apex, flanked by acolytes who form the two legs. At the base, each depicts the conflict to be resolved. The differences between the two reflect the distinction that Blake makes between the rational faculty in the World of Separation and the intellect provided by knowledge. While a crowned Solomon sits in a static pose, looking straight ahead at the women in front of him, the haloed Saviour is dynamic, conversing with those around him, though his gaze is in a direct line with Judas. The contrast suggests that the difference is not moral but intellectual: the Saviour knows that Judas, though he hides in the corner, back to the table, has sold him out.</p>

<p>There is no point in condemning Solomon for usurping divine justice or for imposing a legalistic interpretation of the Law. As indicated by <i>The Last Supper</i>, however, those in the Christian era cannot rely on ignorance for their excuse. They should remediate the Old Testament through the esoteric reading of the New in order to develop the true intellectual faculty.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#cbcbcb; margin-top: 30px">Blake's Esoteric Characteristics</h3>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><b>Universal Correspondences</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(43);"><i>Mercy and Truth Are Met Together, Righteousness and Peace Have Kissed Each Other</i></a></li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(44);"><i>The Four and Twenty Elders Casting Their Crowns before the Divine Throne</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The belief in universal correspondences reconfigures cosmology from the conventional view of a three-part system (heaven above, the created world in the middle, and hell below) into four planes. From this expanded perspective, the exoteric cosmos (heaven/&#8203;earth/&#8203;hell) is equivalent to only one plane&mdash;&#8203;the World of Fact, the lowest plane of the World of Separation, whose relationship with the World of Emanation (the divine idea) has been severed. The esoteric reading of the New Testament fulfills the function of knowledge, providing a medium through which cosmic unity can be restored.</p>

<p>Although its title is borrowed from Psalm 85:10 in the Old Testament, details of <i>Mercy and Truth Are Met Together, Righteousness and Peace Have Kissed Each Other</i> are hard to reconcile with an exoteric reading of the text. Butlin infers that "Mercy is Blake's typical Christ-like figure" (1: 348) and Bindman sees "allegorical personifications of Mercy and Truth" (142). Yet Mary Lynn Johnson asserts that "it would be difficult to identify Jesus and his partner as Peace and Righteousness, who have 'kissed each other,' or to recognize the angels who meet at the top of the design as Mercy and Truth." She contrasts what she sees as "the cold formality of Blake's almost oppressively symmetrical composition" with "this conventional image of the deity, benign and grandfatherly, occup[ying] the ostensible position of power in the upper two-thirds of the picture" (130).</p>

<p>The apparent contradictions are resolved when the illustration is mediated through the <a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(38);"><i>Sefirotic</i> Tree</a>. Formally, the picture corresponds to the World of Separation, as indicated by two triangles. The first consists of <i>Da'at</i> (knowledge)&mdash;&#8203;which Blake personifies as the "benign and grandfatherly" manifestation of the deity&mdash;&#8203;as the apex, connected by diagonal lines to <i>Gevurah</i> (strength) and <i>Hesed</i> (grace); the top stair implies the horizontal from <i>Gevurah</i> to <i>Hesed</i>. The second is <i>Tif'eret</i> (beauty), which Blake personifies as the embracing couple, connected to <i>Hod</i> (glory) and <i>Netzah</i> (victory); the bottom step implies the horizontal. The composition only gestures toward the highest plane, the World of Emanation, the unseen apex where the two diagonals (the angels) flanking <i>Da'at</i> come together. That point corresponds to the first <i>Sefirah</i>, <i>Keter</i>, the head of the Central Column. This is the divine idea, which will remain hidden until cosmic restoration has been achieved.</p>

<p>The omission is compensated for in the New Testament illustration <i>The Four and Twenty Elders Casting Their Crowns before the Divine Throne</i>, based on Revelation 4:2-11. As in <a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(42);"><i>The Last Supper</i></a>, the bottom half is basically triangular, with the figure on the throne corresponding to the Saviour, flanked by the elders. At the base of the triangle are seven heads with crowns of flames. This scene is framed by the multicolored arcs of the covenantal rainbow that completes the implications of <i>Mercy and Truth</i>. Together, the two pictures project cosmic restoration, showing how the World of Separation is intended to correspond to the World of Emanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><b>Living Nature</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(45);"><i>Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</i></a></li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(46);"><i>The River of Life</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">The concept of living nature redirects ontology from the material to the spiritual. Our World of Fact was originally intended to be purely spiritual; as a result of the primordial fault, each plane of the World of Separation was lowered a degree, making ours corporeal, subject to death. Corporeality is signified by the contamination of the lights of purity by the shards of negation, the purpose of the Modern Constitution being to separate out the shards so that the lights can rise again. From this perspective, everything is alive, and the assumption that death is permanent is but a misconception that obscures the truth about living nature. From the Old Testament, <i>Pestilence: The Death of the First-Born</i> conveys the delusion about mortality, an error exposed by <i>The River of Life</i> from the New.</p>

<p><i>Pestilence</i> is based on Exodus 12:21-23, 29-30. In an exoteric reading,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">The angel standing in the doorway in the background presumably refers to Moses' promise of protection to the Jews who marked their door lintels and side posts with the blood of the Passover lamb. The same verses, 21-3, refer to the Lord's "destroyer", personified by Blake as a huge figure with scales. (Butlin 1: 340)</p>

<p>Bindman sees a typological relationship between <i>Pestilence</i> and <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/biblicalwc?descId=but486.1.wc.01" target="_blank"><i>The Woman Taken in Adultery</i></a>:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">The wrath Moses invokes in the Plagues of Egypt, represented by a watercolour of <i>Pestilence</i> &hellip; may on the other hand contrast with Christ's display of forgiveness in the watercolour of <i>Christ and the woman taken in adultery</i>, for Moses as law-giver was the spiritual ancestor of the Pharisees, whose legalism was overthrown by Christ's mercy. (144)</p>

<p>Anagogically, <i>Pestilence</i> manifests contamination of the lights of purity by the shards of negation. Overall, the picture is executed in black and gray tones, illuminated by white outlines and emanations. The central figure, distinguished by his scaly green exterior, dominates the scene, striding across the page, arms out in cruciform. Beneath, clusters of figures bend over the dead he leaves in his wake. Clearly, the literal implication is that he is the instrument of death. As the only dynamic figure, he can also be read as the essence of (re)generation, his green scales suggesting vegetation and hence the life cycle, the phase when the shards of negation are separated from the lights of purity.</p>

<p>As its New Testament counterpart, <i>The River of Life</i> (Revelation 22:1-2) re-presents the scene, depicting the living nature of creation. Naomi Billingsley sees the picture as "symbolic of Christ sharing in the lot of humankind &hellip;. In short then, this is an image of Christ as one of us, and we are presented with the choice of whether to join his company or to suffer the division that befalls Satan" (98).</p>

<p>Esoterically, Blake adds details and figures that link the New Testament account with the World of Separation, as depicted in <i>Pestilence</i>. When the two are juxtaposed, <i>The River of Life</i> can be read as the spiritual transformation that occurs when the lights of purity are liberated. Replacing the central figure of <i>Pestilence</i>, symbol of death and hence generation, is the regenerative river of life, and the clusters of crouching mortals now rise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">In the post-Enlightenment West, knowledge is viewed empirically, based on the logical analysis of data derived from the senses. Without discounting the need for factual information, esotericists posit the kind of knowledge acquired spiritually, sometimes from external visions, other times from the imagination. Two of the most significant of the Old Testament illustrations&mdash;&#8203;<i>Ezekiel's Wheels</i> and <i>Jacob's Dream</i>&mdash;&#8203;illustrate external and internal sources of knowledge respectively. From the New Testament, <i>"And the Angel Which I Saw Lifted Up His Hand to Heaven"</i> indicates how they can be combined into the visionary faculty.</p>

<p>The epitome of an external vision, <i>Ezekiel's Wheels</i> is based on the first chapter of Ezekiel. Historically, contemplation of Ezekiel's chariot constitutes the earliest form of Kabbalism (Spector, <i>"Wonders Divine"</i> 39-40). Revolving around the belief that contemplation of the descent of the chariot promotes the ascent of consciousness, <i>Merkavah</i> or Chariot Mysticism identifies the four wheels as the four cosmic planes, the four animals as the souls governing each of the planes, and the individual sitting on the throne as <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, primordial man. Christian kabbalists associate <i>Adam Kadmon</i> with their Saviour.</p>

<p><i>Ezekiel's Wheels</i> is Blake's version of <i>Merkavah</i> Mysticism, as Rowland notes:</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">The link between humanity and divinity, as well as the complexity of human personality, is hinted at in the painting "Ezekiel's Wheels" &hellip;, redolent of that humanity in divinity found in the Jewish and early patristic exegesis of the <i>merkabah</i>. What is striking about this picture is that it is the human figure among the four creatures surrounding the divine throne-chariot &hellip; that is prominently depicted. Indeed, in Jewish interpretations &hellip; it is the human figure of a man which was especially picked out and a link established between the divine <i>merkabah</i> and ancestors of the faith, such as Jacob or Abraham. Blake here also evokes the amber &hellip; and blue of the sapphire in Ezek 1:26 &hellip;. (141)</p>

<p>Kabbalistically, the two figures together represent aspects of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, the one at the top, the Ancient of Days, the other, the Son, his active manifestation whose function is to separate out the shards so that the lights can rise.</p>

<p>Its title indicating an internal vision, <i>Jacob's Dream</i> is an illustration of Genesis 28:11-12. At the bottom, a purely physical Jacob sleeps, arms spread out in cruciform. Above him, the dream spans the four cosmic planes. On the lowest, clusters of women and children are engaged in the tasks of everyday reality. Next, a group ascends to the World of Archetypal Formation, governed by the Rational Soul; significantly, the lowest figure holds a compass. The third plane, the World of Prototypical Creation, governed by the Spiritual Soul, is occupied by diaphanous figures, some embracing. Finally, at the top, in the World of Emanation, the Immortal Soul is associated with the source of light.</p>

<p>Combining mediation and the imagination, <i>"And the Angel Which I Saw Lifted Up His Hand to Heaven"</i> can be read as <i>Da'at</i>, the kind of knowledge through which the individual can apprehend the divine idea on the microcosmic level and the World of Separation can be reunited with the World of Emanation on the macrocosmic. The illustration is based on chapter 10 of Revelation, a passage that explains how the external vision can be internalized. According to the text, by consuming the book held by the angel, John of Patmos can become a prophet&mdash;&#8203;that is, develop his visionary faculty.</p>

<p>Blake eliminates the iconic angel wings to produce an image that can be read anagogically in several ways. As a self-contained entity, the main figure is a dynamic version of the <a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(39);">human configuration</a> of the <i>Sefirotic</i> Tree. At his feet, in the World of Fact, sits John of Patmos, recording his vision. On the next plane, corresponding to the loins, are black-and-white figures in the World of Archetypal Formation. Lateral with his heart, site of the World of Prototypical Creation, where the divine idea is actualized on the spiritual plane, are rays originating from the source of light behind his head, in the World of Emanation. In addition to suggesting the <i>Sefirotic</i> Tree as a whole, the posture of the angel signifies <i>Da'at</i>, whose function is to bridge the gap between the World of Separation at his feet and the World of Emanation, the absent plane gestured toward by the open palm of his right hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><b>Transmutation</b></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:orangered" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(51);"><i>The Conversion of Saul</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">By replacing the doctrines of original sin and judgment with the concepts of exile and return, esotericism redefines salvation from personal retribution to cosmic reparation, the means by which the primordial fault, which caused the separation of the lower three planes from the World of Emanation, can be corrected through knowledge.</p>

<p>Although it is not found in the Bible, the subtitle of <i>David Delivered out of Many Waters: "He Rode upon the Cherubim"</i> is used to justify a typological reading of Psalm 18:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">Blake shows cherubim of four distinct ages, that in the middle being David as a young man. They are &hellip; the Seven Eyes of God, who, acting in concert with Christ, represent the ideal form of redemption. Below David is being delivered as an older man, bound in the attitude of the Crucified and looking up toward the figure of Christ with similarly outstretched arms, by which Blake makes plain the Psalmist's foreshadowing of Man's salvation through Christ. (Butlin 1: 347)</p>

<p>Bindman expands the reading to include Swedenborg: "The typological implications of Blake's treatment, in which David is rescued by a vision of Christ's mercy, might suggest the influence of medieval manuscripts, but they are implicit also in the Swedenborgian conception of Christ as the only true God" (142).</p>

<p>Diverging from the critical trend, Johnson notes that "nothing in the literal text of Psalm 18 provides any basis whatsoever for Blake's interpretation of David as a proto-Christian" (125).</p>

<p>Anagogically, the picture reflects an esoteric reading of the psalm about David's liberation, as introduced by the dedicatory first verse: "A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul" (18:1). The enemies in general, and the mad King Saul in particular, symbolize the intellectual error to be corrected.</p>

<p>Formally, the picture projects cosmic restoration, with the three planes of the World of Separation forming a dynamic unity. At the top, corresponding to the World of Prototypical Creation, is the Saviour. Floating over the scene, with his outstretched arms encompassing the breadth of the picture, he embodies the actualization of the divine idea on the spiritual plane. Beneath him, the seven angels signify the World of Archetypal Formation, where the primordial fault must be corrected so that the World of Fact at the bottom can be returned to its original spiritual nature. The potential restoration is signified by David, positioned as the mirror image of the Saviour, though bound down in the sea of time and space.</p>

<p>The New Testament counterpart, <i>The Conversion of Saul</i>, associates esoteric Christianity with the kind of knowledge through which the World of Separation can be reunited with the divine idea in the World of Emanation. The picture is a relatively literal illustration of Acts 9:3-7. As noted by Robert N. Essick,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">Rather than falling "to the earth," as the Bible describes Saul, Blake pictures him astride a great horse that has gone to ground. Saul looks up to the vision above in rapt awe and extends his arms in a cruciform gesture that foreshadows his acceptance of Christ's crucifixion as a cornerstone of his new faith. (78)</p>

<p>By having Saul sit astride the horse, Blake maintains the upward trajectory; had he fallen to the ground, symbolically he would have suffered a kind of relapse. Instead, the experience is beyond the capability of the Animal Soul, symbolized by the horse. In addition, Blake maintains the visual emphasis of his interpretation. The account in Acts is likely a reference to <i>bat kol</i>, literally "daughter of a voice," symbolizing an auditory experience through which God's will is revealed to man. Although instances of <i>bat kol</i> occur throughout both Testaments, it was considered an inferior means of communication. In his version, Blake visualizes the source of knowledge, which points out the direction Saul should take: "Saul's raiment is touched by the yellow of the heavenly Christ; Christ is surrounded in a whirl of light by other figures, either the heavenly host as in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4-5, or the Christians with whom Christ is linked, whom Saul is persecuting" (Rowland 221). Ultimately, when Saul becomes Paul, he will personify <i>Da'at</i>, his evangelism providing the knowledge to mediate between the World of Separation, signified by the buckling horse, and the World of Emanation, personified by the Saviour and the cluster of surrounding angels.</p>

Kendall DeBoer</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">As a foundational framework for much of Western thought, the Judeo-Christian Bible also provides the basis for archetypes of femininity. These gendered models appear in various forms across media, space, and time. Biblical narratives have shaped two of the most pervasive character roles for women: the virgin and the vixen. The former type is epitomized in the Madonna, the Virgin Mary, who miraculously gives birth to Jesus Christ. The latter appears much earlier, in Genesis, as Eve succumbs to the serpent's temptation, indulging in forbidden fruit. The pull between virgin and vixen appears throughout extrabiblical legends, notably in interpretations of Mary Magdalene's life as a repentant prostitute-turned-saint. In the final book of the New Testament, Revelation, the dichotomy persists. The Woman Clothed in the Sun (also known as the Woman of the Apocalypse) symbolically stands for the Virgin Mary, giving birth to a son parallel to Jesus whom a Satanic dragon attempts to destroy. Within the same book, the Whore of Babylon wreaks havoc as an idolatress, "the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth."</p>

<p>These biblical mythologies not only prefigure literary tropes of the feminine, but also inform Western visual representations of women. Blake depicts all the characters above, and thereby contributes to an ongoing, ever-changing, gendered visual legacy that both predates and outlives his work. This thematic gallery explores Blake's approach in his artworks rendering these archetypical women and considers how his illustrations build upon and deviate from extant Western art historical models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(52);"><i>The Creation of Eve: "And She Shall Be Called Woman"</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Rather than depicting Eve budding from Adam's rib cage, Blake illustrates her birth as a meeting conducted by the divine. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, "The grape vines entwined around the tree symbolize marriage; the exotic red and blue plumed birds represent the newly created souls; and the giant oak leaf on which Adam reclines forecasts humankind's suffering," while a lion nearby "signals the peace of the pre-fallen world." The central entity, identified as God in the Archive's illustration description, stands alongside the first man and woman and reflects Blake's recurrent interest in encounters between humans and the divine.</p>

<p>Adam's reclining body echoes the right angle of the bottom-left corner, acting as a framing device for God's introduction of Eve. God and Eve stand column-like; their vertical, tall bodies are almost parallel. Eve's verticality corporeally aligns her with the central deity. She arrives in the garden by way of blue clouds, which further suggest mystical power. To connect Adam and Eve, God holds one of the hands of each. Although Adam receives the preferred right hand of God, the divine conduit joins the couple through an almost-identical act of touch. This reimagining of Eve's birth contrasts not only pictorially with the traditional Eve sprouting from Adam trope, but also symbolically via the linking of hands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(53);"><i>Eve Naming the Birds</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">This image is a companion to <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/adam-naming-the-beasts-83208" target="_blank"><i>Adam Naming the Beasts</i></a>. Blake's subject deviates both from preceding artists' depictions of Eve and from the Bible itself. There is no biblical reference to Eve naming the birds&mdash;&#8203;in Genesis 2:20 Adam names all the birds before Eve's creation. This perplexing painting leaves viewers to wonder why Blake decided to play with the creation narrative in this manner.</p>

<p>In <i>Blake and Antiquity</i>, Kathleen Raine argues that "Eve's birds are the lureing birds of love," connecting this image to women's sexuality and generation (41). She compares the painting to Lyca in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/s-inn.b?descId=s-inn.b.illbk.19" target="_blank">"The Little Girl Lost,"</a> who wanders "Hearing wild birds song," and draws attention to Leutha, described as the "lureing bird of Eden" in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>Eve's position at the compositional center, her slight gaze toward her right, her nudity, and her long, curly, golden hair recall the famous art historical icon of divine feminine sexuality, Botticelli's <a href="https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/birth-of-venus" target="_blank"><i>Birth of Venus</i></a> (c. 1485). These similarities may support the argument that Eve evokes love, beauty, and sexuality. There are, however, some key iconographic differences that distinguish Blake's painting and further highlight its idiosyncrasies. Botticelli's Venus stands in a <i>pudica</i> pose, covering her breasts with her right hand and her genitals with her left to preserve her modesty. Additionally, the Hora of Spring stands to Venus's left, waiting to cover her body with a large textile. In contrast, Blake's Eve stands with both of her hands raised and fingers splayed; she uses her right hand to play with her hair. In her prelapsarian state, Eve has no conception of shame in relation to her nudity. The openness of her posture displays, in this sense, her innocence. Though it is unclear whether Blake would have intentionally referenced Botticelli, the <i>pudica</i> pose informed foundational aspects of canonical, academic Western artmaking.</p>

<p>Another reading of this painting emerges from the fact that there are three birds present, framing Eve's face. They may allude to a triadic understanding of God as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;&#8203;the third of which often appears as a dove. In biblical, apocryphal, and folkloric accounts, birds may signify divine presence. Thus, alongside the connection to sexuality and procreation posited by Raine, the birds may connect Eve once more to divinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(54);"><i>Eve Tempted by the Serpent</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Once more, Eve appears vertical, central, and fully nude. As in <a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(52);"><i>The Creation of Eve</i></a>, Adam lies horizontally across the bottom of the composition, though in this work he no longer acts as a framing device and instead blends in with the ground as he sleeps. As in <a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(53);"><i>Eve Naming the Birds</i></a>, Eve stands exposed, this time stretching an arm upward, reaching for the tree branch with her hand in a manner not unlike the <i>adlocutio</i> reserved for generals and emperors. Typically, this pose appears in monumental sculptures of a single <i>contrapposto</i> figure, right arm raised, sometimes pointing a finger, leading masses to victory. Eve, too, stands <i>contrapposto</i>, right arm lifted victoriously, chin held high, as her glistening, highlighted figure commands attention. Even the enormous serpent curled around her feet and spiraling skyward seems more like an accessory or a backdrop.</p>

<p>The Victoria and Albert Museum notes that Blake's inspiration stems from both Genesis and John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>&#8202;; Blake illustrates the same temptation scene as part of his water color sets devoted to <i>Paradise Lost</i> (<a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but529.1?descId=but529.1.wc.09" target="_blank">1807</a>, <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/but536.1?descId=but536.1.wc.09" target="_blank">1808</a>). More so than the later water colors, this tempera conjures the strength and independence of the Eve introduced in Milton's text. In book 9 of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, monologues trace Eve's thought process leading up to her decision to eat the forbidden fruit and her feelings afterwards. She reasons: "What fear I then, rather what know to feare / Under this ignorance of good and Evil, / Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? / Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, / Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, / Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then / To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?" (lines 773-79).</p>

<p>Though the serpent contributes to beguiling Eve, Milton's presentation of the inner workings of her mind grants her some degree of agency. She even considers withholding the fruit from Adam: "Shall I / &hellip; / keep the odds of Knowledge in my power / Without Copartner? so to add what wants / In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, / And render me more equal, and perhaps, /A thing not undesireable, somtime / Superior: for inferior who is free?" (lines 817, 820-25). Fantasizing about her possible superiority over Adam, Milton's Eve demonstrates ambition and desire. Likewise, Blake's tempera painting shows Eve in an unprecedented manner by placing her in the visual tradition of <i>adlocutio</i>, suggesting her likeness to imperial leaders, who also find themselves driven by ambition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(55);"><i>The Virgin and Child in Egypt</i></a></li></p>

<p><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(56);"><i>Virgin and Child</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">These paintings are overt references to the longstanding Christian iconographic tradition of the Madonna and child. Though created at different scales, with fifteen years in between, they share several distinctive compositional details. In both, Mary raises her hands while looking down at her son. The infant Christ gazes outward, toward the viewer, head tilted slightly. The mother's softly sloping shoulders appear almost cape-like, enshrouding the baby Jesus as if her body itself were an aureola. Byzantinesque haloes frame the central figures, as divinity radiates from mother and child alike.</p>

<p>The Victoria and Albert Museum notes that <i>The Virgin and Child in Egypt</i> is part of a set of four with <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/adam-naming-the-beasts-83208" target="_blank"><i>Adam Naming the Beasts</i></a>, <a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(53);"><i>Eve Naming the Birds</i></a>, and <a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/230048" target="_blank"><i>Christ Blessing</i></a>, and suggests that the group shows "the fall and redemption of mankind." This image depicts the Madonna and child sheltering under a palm tree, the iconographic trope of the rest on the flight into Egypt. The story and the accompanying miracle of the palm tree are largely apocryphal. The natural and spiritual aspects of the scenery coalesce, as the palm frond curves around Mary's halo to form another arc encircling her figure.</p>

<p>In <i>Virgin and Child</i>, Mary cries and smiles simultaneously, demonstrating the complexity of her emotional experience. Many medieval and Renaissance paintings include specific articulations of both the Virgin's and the child's hands; the former might gesture toward her son, grasp onto him, or hold her hands in prayer, while the latter might raise a hand in benediction. Blake represents the duo with their hands raised, recalling Eve's pose in <i>Eve Naming the Birds</i>. Both Mary and Jesus (and Eve) face one palm outward and one palm inward, suggesting continuity between all three divine figures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(57);"><i>The Assumption of the Virgin</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">This water color features Mary at its center; her hands reach outward and upward as her vertical body floats toward an infant Christ. Radiant light in a triangular form surrounds her, while Christ levitates in the center of a circular, nimbus-like aura. Nine figures&mdash;&#8203;seemingly apostles&mdash;&#8203;kneel on the ground. Some of the group gaze toward the rejuvenated, energized Mary. Like the majority of Blake's representations of Mary, this image derives its content from extrabiblical sources.</p>

<p>In "The Death and Assumption of Blake's Mary," Mary Lynn Johnson posits that the scene is closer to an ascension than an assumption, as Mary seems to rise with her own divine force, unaided. The latter term typically describes angels drawing the Virgin to heaven via the power of the Trinity. Blake's depiction inverts the triangle of the Trinity by framing Mary with the same shape upside down, and he surrounds her with cherubs swooping downward, tossing flowers, and admiring her.</p>

<p>Johnson argues that, because of the rarity of printed texts documenting apocryphal tales, Blake likely drew inspiration from pictorial sources. Though he probably encountered engravings of this subject by Dürer and after Raphael, his interpretation stands distinct in its departure from iconographic norms. Johnson points out that "Blake's <i>Assumption</i> sets aside the most familiar version of the story in art: the arrival of Thomas too late to witness Mary's beatific passing, his request that the tomb be opened, and the disciples' discovery that it is empty except for flowers, as Mary is bodily taken up into heaven, casting her girdle or sash down to the unbelieving Thomas" (155).</p>

<p>Animate, spirited, and active, Blake's ascending Mary materializes celebratory agency also found in his depictions of <a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(54);">Eve</a> and the <a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(58);">Woman Clothed in the Sun</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(58);"><i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun: "The Devil Is Come Down"</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">Chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation describes a dragon (Satan) threatening a woman&mdash;&#8203;known as the Woman Clothed in the Sun or the Woman of the Apocalypse&mdash;&#8203;and her newborn baby. Many historic and modern interpreters identify her as the Virgin Mary; alternatively, some believe that she represents the Church. Because Blake did not subscribe to organized religious institutions, it is unlikely that the woman in his representation definitively correlates to either Mary or the Church in any rigid sense. Still, her placement in the composition stands in direct contrast to the Satanic entity looming above her. Viewers can intuit that she embodies an opposing force to the dragon-devil, and instead aligns with Christian spirituality.</p>

<p>Blake's Woman Clothed in the Sun is angelic, equipped with orange-toned feathery wings and encircled with nimbus-like, radiant flames for hair. The majority of this water color is dark gray, almost monochromatic, which puts the woman's bright yellow-orange in relief. Though kneeling and seemingly pregnant, she holds her arms horizontally, palms facing outward, and tilts her chin upward to look directly at the seven-headed beast hovering overhead. The horizontality of her arms mirrors the devil's, underlining that she acts as an opposite force with comparable divine strength. Flanked by lightning and just under an encroaching, serpentine tail, she maintains her stance and appears unfazed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px"><li style="display:inline list-item"><a style="color:turquoise" href="" ng-click="exhibitCtrl.scrollTo(59);"><i>The Whore of Babylon</i></a></li></p>

<p style="margin-top: 30px">As the central figure, the Whore of Babylon (Revelation 17) towers over all others in this design, with the exception of her steed. She sits with a somewhat languid pose, resting her left arm at her side to point downward and crossing her bare feet. Her breasts are exposed and she wears a lot of ornate accessories: a triple-tiered crown, dangling earrings, a short pearl choker, a longer golden necklace with a heart-shaped pendant, and beaded bangles for her ankles and wrists. She also wears a fairly decorative skirt, with a ruffle detail around the waist and zig-zag hemline adorned with scallop-like jewels or lace trim. Blake's attention to her adornments echoes the description in Revelation of a woman "decked with gold and precious stones and pearls." She holds the "golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication," which features two coiled serpents, perhaps referencing the snake's role in Eve's original sin.</p>

<p>If the cup contains evidence of her filthy fornication, the seven nude women in the smoke that emanates from it would seemingly promise abomination, but these ghostly ladies are fairly nondescript, even abstract. They hold items like pitchers, trumpets, cups, and bowls, but are otherwise anonymous. With a melancholy expression, Babylon looks upward toward the spirits floating out of her goblet. Her facial expression is ambiguous, though her pursed lips and almost furrowed brow suggest unhappiness. The expression is not strong or extreme enough to be upset, horrified, enraged, or grief stricken, but she is not happy either. She gazes with despondent apathy or anxious uncertainty that seems unbefitting a powerful incarnation of evil.</p>

<p>The dagger hemline of her skirt formally parallels the spiked ridges on her beast's upper back, as well as his large locks of fur that appear as layers of tufts running down his lower back. His seven heads have their own horns and crowns, signaling their relationship to the kings mentioned in Revelation. The four lower heads are focused on terrorizing tiny humans&mdash;&#8203;the lowest is in the process of eating someone&mdash;&#8203;while the other three gaze toward the goblet-spirits and Babylon. The head closest to Babylon, which is also the most in the foreground, has yet another unexpected and ambiguous facial expression. Mouth agape, brows furrowed, and eyes wide, he seems emotionally engaged with Babylon in some capacity.</p>

<p>Blake renders Babylon remarkably static, even lethargic, in this scene. Evil seems like a force independent of her, which controls and operates the scene. Blake's illustration introduces nuance and uncertainty, and thereby sidesteps outright condemnation of her as an individual figure.</p>
