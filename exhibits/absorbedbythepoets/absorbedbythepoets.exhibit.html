<h2 style="text-align:center;color:#eabd39"><b>“Absorbed by the Poets”: the Sources and Hanging Arrangement for Blake’s Eighteen Heads of Poets</b></h2>


<h3 style="text-align:center;color:#eabd39">by Mark Crosby</h3>

<p>
When William and Catherine moved to the small village of Felpham in Sussex, it was with the expectation of steady work from William Hayley. Settling into a cottage built of recovered ship timbers, the Blakes were a short walk from Hayley’s Turret House residence.<sup><a class="footnote">1<span>For Blake’s cottage in Felpham, see Mark Crosby, “‘The Sweetest Spot on Earth’: Reconstructing William Blake’s Cottage,” <i>British Art Journal</i> 3:1 (Spring 2007) 46-53.</span></a></sup>  After the death of his son, Thomas Alphonso, on 2 May 1800 Hayley moved into Turret House, downsizing from his nearby estate at Eartham.  To accommodate all his books and his son’s collection, Hayley repurposed a storeroom on the ground floor of Turret House to use as an additional library with the main library on the second floor.  In late September or early October 1800, Hayley commissioned Blake to decorate the upper library of Turret House with a series of portraits of authors. In November, Hayley made one of his regular visits to the family of his friend, the miniaturist Jeremiah Meyer in Kew, leaving Blake alone in the Turret House upper library to research the commission. Writing to Hayley on 26 November 1800, Blake informs his patron that he has been “absorbed by the poets Milton, Camoens, [sic] Ercilla, Ariosto and Spenser, whose physiogomies have been my delightful study” (E714). Blake appears to have taken over a year to finish the commission, telling Thomas Butts in a letter of 11 September 1801, “Now I must express my wishes to see you in Felpham & to shew you Mr. Hayley’s Library which is still unfinished but is in a finishing way & looks well” (E 716).

The final series comprises portraits of Homer, Demonsthenes, Cicero, Dante, Chaucer, Camöens, Ercilla, Tasso, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Otway, Pope, Voltaire, Klopstock, Cowper, and Thomas Alphonso. Contrary to Blake’s letter to Hayley of 286 November, there is no extant portrait of Ariosto. The majority of the portraits reflect Hayley’s classical education, and poetic and philosophical interests. The portraits may have also functioned as a system of visual classification and while the inclusion of the portrait of Thomas Alphonso was a late addition, it was likely part of Hayley’s broader memorialisation of his son.

After Hayley death and in accordance with his will, the contents of the libraries at Turret House were sold. Blake’s portraits were not included in the thirteen-day sale and presumably remained in the upper library until they were removed during the mid-nineteenth century and seemingly dispersed.  In 1860 Alexander Gilchrist saw five of the portrait heads and William Michael Rossetti included the series in his catalogue of Blake’s paintings.  By 5 December 1885 the series had been reassembled and was sold at Christie’s auction house. The following year the Manchester City Art Gallery purchased the series.

In Spring 1969 the Manchester City Art Gallery exhibited Blake’s portraits and offered a conjectural hanging arrangement based on the dimensions of the paintings.  Since this exhibition, the paintings have undergone restoration. Using evidence from the restored paintings, the original architectural plans for Turret House, and Hayley’s correspondence, this exhibit offers an updated hanging arrangement for Blake’s eighteen portrait heads. Comprising two galleries, the exhibition traces the construction of Hayley’s Turret House and its upper library before providing a new hanging arrangement and possible sources available in Hayley’s libraries for the portrait heads.
