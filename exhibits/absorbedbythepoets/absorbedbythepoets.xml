            <p><br/>Hayley was an amateur physician, dispensing quack remedies to his friends and neighbours, and enthusiastically practicing and advocating sea-bathing as a cure-all treatment. Prompted by the frequent bouts of ill health suffered by his son in 1796 Hayley conceived of a dual-purpose residence near the coast:</p>
            <blockquote>I am finishing my little marine villa, in a comfortable hope that it will be singularly beneficial to the recovery of my dear artist, and we shall render it, I believe, so commodious, that it may even serve me for a winter residence.<sup><a class="footnote">5<span>See Elizabeth Johnston, <i>For Friendship’s Sake, William Blake and William Hayley</i>, (Manchester 1969).</span></a></sup></blockquote>
            <p>Thomas Alphonso was Hayley’s only child, born out of wedlock to the daughter of Hayley’s nursemaid, Sarah Betts. From a young age, Thomas Alphonso demonstrated an interest in art and became a pupil of both George Romney and John Flaxman. In this painting, Thomas Alphonso stands with his back to the viewer, assisting Flaxman in sculpting a gigantic bust of his father, who faces the viewer. Behind Hayley, Romney peers smirking above his easel. Thomas Alphonso’s contrapposto pose hints at the curvature of spine that contributed to his early death in May 1800.</p>

                <br/>This may have been a preparatory drawing for a more finished study or for an engraving. The drawing depicts Thomas Alphonso standing behind a table with a finger resting on his chin and holding a classical statue to signify the subject’s status as a sculptor. On the table is a scroll bearing “EPISTLES to John Flaxman Sculptor”. It is possible that Hayley wanted this image engraved for his poem, An <i>Essay on Sculpture</i> (1800), which was dedicated to Flaxman and contains three engravings by Blake, including a portrait of Thomas Alphonso in profile after Flaxman’s medallion of his pupil: https://www.blakearchive.org/copy/bb467.1?descId=bb467.1.comeng.03
                It is also conceivable that Blake made this drawing after the death of Thomas Alphonso to illustrate a biography that Hayley was writing during the first few years of the nineteenth century.

                Hayley selected Felpham for the location of Thomas Alphonso’s ‘Marine villa’ as it was close to his own home at Eartham and a short walk from the English Channel, allowing him to be both close to his son and for Thomas Alphonso to enjoy daily sea-bathing sessions. Hayley contacted Flaxman and the architect responsible for George Romney’s studio, Samuel Bunce, about the project, proposing a circular structure.

            <p>
                <br/>In a letter to Hayley of 11 September 1796, Flaxman reports that he and Bunce, whom he refers to as “the man of Capitals &#38; Cornices”, had recently “held a council concerning your intended building”. Following Hayley’s suggestion, their initial proposal was a circular tower comprising three floors, a wraparound balcony on the first floor, and a vestibule leading to an internal staircase. In his letter, Flaxman includes three sketches depicting the front, “oblique, and plan perspectives of the tower and notes that “the circle ‘tho a beautiful figure is much better suited to many other Architectural purposes than the conveniences of a dwelling, yet according to your idea I think it may be well employed”.

            <p>
                <br/>Writing to Hayley on 31 March 1797, Bunce optimistically states, “your building will not take more than between two &#38; three months.” The following month, Bunce sent Hayley a modified plan that of the ‘Marine villa’ that incorporates Flaxman’s circular tower and internal staircase. This plan indicates that the new house was designed around the library, a circular room that was perhaps modelled after Horace Walpole’s at Strawberry Hill. The proposed library is located on the upper floor and was to be subdivided into two floors. A side elevation shows that there would be six windows on each floor, with a fireplace on the northern aspect of the room and chimneybreasts on both floor. This early plan also indicates that the remainder of the house would comprise three ground-floor rooms, a kitchen and parlour, with the third room under the library left for Hayley to decide upon. Whether it was due to expense or taste, this plan was rejected.</p>

                <br/>Bunce sent a series of revised plans to Hayley a month later. These plans are drawn on the verso of a sheet of paper included with Bunce’s letter to Hayley of 29 April 1797 and demonstrate the importance of the library in the overall design of the dwelling. The redesigned ‘Marine villa’ was a rectangular structure with a rectangular library again located on the second floor. The first sketched plan situates the library running the entire length of the northern aspect of the house. It is the largest room in the house and contains a fireplace opposite the only door. There is a window in each aspect.</p>

            Bunce to Hayley, 29 April 1797. Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.
            <p><br/>In the same packet, Bunce sent a second set of plans labeled ground floor and upper floor. These plans include measurements and room designations. The plans depict a two-floor structure with external measurements of 10.3 m by 8.2 m. The structure is divided centrally by a narrow corridor that terminates in a turret on the south aspect. Either side of the corridor is a wing that is subdivided into rooms. The ground-floor west wing comprises two rooms, a kitchen on the southern aspect, measuring 5.4 m by 3.9 m and a storeroom on the northern aspect, measuring 4.2 m by 3 m. The east wing is also divided into two rooms, a dining room on the southern aspect, measuring 4.5 m by 3.9 m, and a workroom on the northern aspect, measuring 4.2 m by 3 m.
            </p>
            <p>
                The upper storey is also divided into two wings. The west wing comprises two bedchambers, the main bedchamber on the northern aspect and a smaller, secondary bedchamber on the southern aspect. There is also a closet, measuring 1.5 m by 1.8 m, located at the northern end of the central corridor. The majority of the central corridor, an area measuring 4.2 m by 1.8 m comprises the library, which occupies the entire east wing of the upper storey. The library measures 7.9 m by 3.9 m, which, including the recess of 4.2 m by 1.8 m, equates to 128.6 m<sup>2</sup> making it the largest room in the house. There are three doors leading from the library to the closet, the main bedchamber and the stairs. A door from the stairs leads to the smaller bedchamber. The library and the two bedchambers each contain fireplaces. The fireplace in the library is located on the north aspect. Thomas Alphono made several sculptural busts for the library’s fireplace, including busts of Homer and Milton.22 The upper library also has four windows, three on the eastern aspect and one on the southern aspect. This design would allow more light to enter the library, particularly in the morning, than the earlier designs.

            Bunce to Hayley, 29 July 1797. Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.
            <p><br/>Like the earlier plans, these revised plans include an internal staircase. The staircase is in a rectangular turret, which also forms part of the entrance and measures 2.1 m<sup>2</sup>. The doorway in the turret was constructed using three great stones, forming a “trilithon”. Bunce informs Hayley of the manner of construction: “There can be no better way than to lay other larger stones or rough flints up to the Trilithon to meet the arch”. In the same letter, Bunce described the house as “the druidical seat”. Blake’s depiction of trilithons in Milton and Jerusalem may have been, in part, influenced by the entrance to Turret House. During a visit to Hayley in 1811, William Godwin records his experiences climbing the turret:
                <blockquote>His house is quite a toy. He has erected a turret on the top, with a corridor over that, for the sake of the prospect, and to this corridor he climbs at least once everyday by a ladder, which can only be descended by crawling backwards, and which, being on the top of the house in the open air, looked to me frightful, but I escaped without breaking either my neck or leg.</blockquote>

            <p><br/>The turret also housed a stained-glass window on the south aspect, with 1 metre diameter on the exterior and 1.05 m diameter on the interior, 0.6 m deep. With a south-facing aspect, the light that was refracted through the thick, multicoloured glass would have made entering the library a unique and possibly transcendent-like experience. The dazzling effects that this window produced, particularly on a sunny day, may have inspired Blake’s connection of Turret House to heaven in his poem addressed to “Anna Flaxman”: “The Ladder of Angels descends thro the air / On the Turret its spiral does softly descend” (E 709).</p>

            <p><br/>Bunce’s sketch of the south aspect of Turret House depicts a two-floor structure with a three-storey tower. Bunce includes a balcony on the turret’s second floor supported by what appear to be columns. Thomas Alphonso laid the foundation stone for Turret House on 15 April 1797 watched by his father, Bunce, and George Romney. While Turret House was demolished in the twentieth century, contemporaneous depictions by Blake and George Engleheart suggest that Bunce’s third design and this sketch of the south aspect were close to the final structure.</p>

            <p><br/>Blake’s unfinished pencil and watercolour sketch depicts the village of Felpham as viewed from the seashore. One of the few landscapes Blake ever created, the sketch shows one of Felpham’s two windmills in the left foreground. Hayley’s Turret House is visible in the centre of the picture. A contemporary account of the village appears to describe the view that Blake painted:
                <blockquote>On the left the eye rests on a lengthened series of cornfields and meadows, extending from the village to the sea-side, bedecking the latter with a gay verdant mantle, even to the water’s edge. Behind those fields arise three or four excellent and commodious dwellings, shaded and embellished by clusters of trees; and what still enhances their merit, commanding a marine landscape in front, and an extensive land view in the rear. </blockquote>
                Blake’s cottage can be seen on the right of sketch, half hidden behind trees and illuminated by a shaft of sunlight. For Blake’s own depiction of his cottage, see https://www.blakearchive.org/copy/milton.a?descId=milton.a.illbk.36</p>

            James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, New Haven.
            <p><br/>An indication of where Blake’s portraits were hung is suggested in Bunce’s letter to Hayley of 20 March 1798, where the architect expresses his concern over the width of a proposed frieze to decorate the Felpham library: “I hope you will not make the frieze so wide as you mention I have therefore only increased it by ½ an inch”. Bunce appears to be referring to a continuous frieze. A sketch on the verso of Bunce and Hayley’s undated plan for the decorations in the upper library supports this notion of a frieze, with a series of portraits were to occupy a position above the chairs, probably in an area between the bookcases and the ceilings. While differing in length, Blake’s portraits are of similar height, which indicates they were hung in an area of uniform height, such as between the bookcases and the ceiling. It must be noted that the exact dimensions of the paintings may have altered as they have been relined at least once.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Britain, the tradition of decorating libraries with portraits of authors in roundel frames as part of a larger frieze located above bookcases may be traced to the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The Bodleian frieze was painted between 1616 and 1618 and consists of 202 portraits in roundels located in a cornice between the bookcases and the ceiling. Between each portrait are depictions of scrolls, books, inkpots and quills. In some instances there are allegorical items associated with the passage of time, such as hour-glasses and skulls. The use of portraits arranged in a frieze was two-fold, to represent visually the classification of subjects within large libraries and to confer authority onto the library and inspiration to its readers. In 1661 Gabriel Naude advocated the pictorial representation of learned men in libraries, declaring that “good copies drawn from such as are most famous in the Profession of letters [act as] a puissant spurre to excite a generous and well-born soul to follow their track [sic]”. This was certainly one of the aims of the frieze in the Bodleian Library. As well as providing intellectual inspiration and subject classification, the decorations in domestic libraries such as Hayley’s also offered visual signification of the tastes and social status of the owner.

            <p><br/>In an undated drawing by Bunce of a rectangular room with a fireplace and at least one window, Hayley has added a series of names of authors, sometimes in a contracted form, next to circles that run along each wall. The circles could denote roundel frames. Starting with Cowper on the lower right of the plan and proceeding clockwise, the authors Hayley lists are as follows: Spenser, Cowley, Cicero, Voltaire, Shakespeare, Dryden, Sappho, Tasso, Camöens, Anacreon, Pope, Euripides, Ariosto, Demosthenes, Horace, Livy, and Edward Gibbon. The exclusion of Thomas Alphonso from this plan and his inclusion in Blake’s eighteen portraits suggests that it was drafted before May 1800 and, therefore, before Blake arrived in Felpham. This sketch of the library does not include features such as the recess and three doors that we see in Bunce’s third design and appears to be based on the rectangular library in his second design. While some of the subjects differ from Blake’s series, this sketch with Hayley’s manuscript additions suggests pairings for eight portraits. It is likely that the sketch represents Hayley’s early, if not initial intensions regarding a positional arrangement for a series of portraits in roundels to decorate the upper library at Turret House.</p>

            Line engraving.
            <p><br/>Hayley’s commission of the 18 portrait heads to decorate his upper library follows a long tradition of adorning libraries with busts and friezes depicting celebrated authors.  When Turret House was conceived as Thomas Alphonso’s seaside residence, Hayley advised his son to decorate his prospective library with busts by Flaxman.  Before his death, Thomas Alphonso sculpted busts of Homer and Milton to decorate the fireplace in the upper library at Turret House.   The inclusion of portraits of famous authors in libraries can be seen in this anonymous seventeenth-century engraving depicting Cicero’s library, with the heads framed in roundels surrounded by wreaths and located above the bookcases.  These portraits should be, according to Gabriel Naude writing in 1661, “good copies drawn from such as are most famous in the Profession of letters” to offer “a puissant spurre [sic] to excite a generous and well-born soul to follow their track”.  Hayley’s owned several books that offered models for depictions of classical figures in roundel frames, such the 1735 edition of <i>The Lives and Characters of Ancient Greek Poet</i>.  As well as inspiration, such portraits were often used to provide a system of visual classification for the contents of the library. According to a manuscript catalogue dated 1772 and in Hayley’s hand and the 1821 auction catalogue of the Felpham libraries, Hayley owned approximately 22 editions relating to Milton, which equated to over 80 volumes; 12 editions relating to Homer, over 40 volumes; 10 editions relating to Shakespeare, over 60 volumes; 13 editions of Cicero, over 20 volumes; 10 editions relating to Dante, over 30 volumes; 10 editions relating to Pope, over 40 volumes; and 68 volumes on British poets. 
        </p><p>
The original frames of Blake’s 18 portrait heads date to circa 1870. While we don’t know how the portraits were originally fixed to the space between the bookcases and the ceiling in Hayley’s upper library, we can speculate that they were either stretched on wooden frames in Chichester or were pasted directly to the wall in imitation of fresco. Blake’s execution of the portraits in his tempera medium may have been informed by how the paintings were mounted. In his annotations to Joshua Reynolds, Blake suggests that his version of fresco can use a wall as a support: “Fresco Painting is Like Miniature Painting; a Wall is a Large Ivory” (E 654). Blake use of light grey and brown washes accentuated by various types of intensely coloured wreaths and subsidiary design, imbue the portraits with a three-dimensional appearance similar to busts. We can surmise from the dimensions of Blake’s 18 portraits, their visual correspondences, and the orientations of the heads, that they were conceived and executed as a group to occupy a single room. This would have been the upper library as it is the only space large enough to accommodate all 18 paintings in a space between the bookcases and the ceiling.

Kenneth Povey and William Wells identified most of the sources of Blake’s 18 portrait heads.  This gallery rehearses these sources, providing additional information on books containing portrait engravings in Hayley’s libraries that Blake consulted. Our knowledge of the contents of Hayley’s Felpham libraries primarily derives from his 1772 manuscript catalogue and the 1821 auction catalogue. While these two documents provide a reliable account of books Hayley owned at specific historical moments, we also know that he sold and borrowed books throughout his life and by 1800 had amassed what his friend, William Meyer, describes as a collection of engraved “Poet’s Heads”.  This collection included a portrait of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and may have comprised Hayley’s collection of portraits of English poets. Drawing on these sources and Hayley’s correspondence, this gallery offers three newly identified sources for Blake’s portraits of Homer, Demosthenes, and Tasso.

       Based on Bunce’s third design for Turret House, the dimensions of the walls of the upper library can be calculated. In this design Bunce does not provide exact dimensions for the windows, so a degree of error must be allowed in the reconstruction of the upper library. Labeled alphabetically and beginning clockwise from the northern wall, the first two wall spaces, labeled A and B, are located either side of the fireplace and each measure 1.2 m each. The fireplace measures 1.5 m and the chimneybreast, which would have run continuously to the ceiling, was narrower, measuring approximately 1.1 m, giving a total of 3.9 m as indicated by Bunce’s revised plan.   
   </p><p>
The eastern wall, labeled C, measures 7.9 m and contains three windows, approximately 0.4 m wide, fitted with sliding shutters.  The southern wall, labeled D, contains one window and measures 3.9 m. The window may also have been approximately 0.4 m wide, with the sections of wall either side of the window measuring 1.5 m. 
</p><p>
The wall sections either side of the recess, E and I, measure 1.8 m. The recess comprises three walls, with three doors in each wall. The doors are approximately 1.2 m wide and 1.7 m high. The wall on the southern aspect of the recess, labeled F, measures 1.8 m and contains a door leading to the turret. The longer wall on the western aspect, labeled G, measures 4.5 m and contains a door leading to the main bedchamber. The northern wall in the recess, labeled H, measures 1.8 m, and contains a door leading to the closet. 
</p><p>
The tonality of the background and subsidiary scenes in the paintings that occupy walls A, B, C and D enhance the statuesque style of the main portrait and make the painting easier to view when not in direct sunlight. Contemporary advice on painting suggests that: “if the Picture be set in a Place which receives little light the colors must be very clear, as on the contrary very brown if the Place be strongly enlightened”.  The position of the paintings on these walls would have been out of direct sunlight and therefore would have necessitated them being clear and more distinct tonally. There are several darker portraits, which probably occupied positions opposite the windows in direct sunlight.
</p><p>
In this reconstruction of the hanging arrangement, I have discounted the possibility of any portraits being located on walls F and H because the height of the door leading to the turret stairs was 1.7 m, which would preclude a portrait with a width of 40-45 cm occupying the area above the doorframe.  Also, due to the door's position, a bookcase would not have been built to occupy the 30 cm gap either side of the doors on walls F and H. This hanging arrangement has the heads of each subject facing in the same orientation when viewed sequentially except for the portrait of Milton.

       The portrait of Homer may have occupied the area on wall D, between wall C and the window. The portrait of Milton, which faces left, may have occupied the area on wall D, between the window and wall E. This placement situates the portraits facing inwards towards the window and opposite walls A and B, thereby complementing the corresponding busts of Homer and Milton by Thomas Alphonso decorating the fireplace. Both portraits have Prussian blue backgrounds and corresponding wreaths of bay leaves, suggesting that they were designed to complement each other. 
 </p><p>      
Blake’s main source for the Milton portrait was George Vertue’s engraving after William Faithorne that was published in the 1732 edition of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, edited by Richard Bentley (a copy of which was in Hayley’s library during Blake’s time in Felpham).  Blake probably also consulted Giovanni Battista Cipriani‘s engraving of a bust of Milton, derived from Faithorne, that was published in <i>Memoirs of Thomas Hollis</i> (1780). A presentation copy of Hollis’s <i>Memoirs</i> is listed in the 1821 auction catalogue. 
</p><p> 
The main source for Blake’s treatment of Homer may have been Carlo Gregori’s 1741 engraving of the Farnese bust after Giovanni Domenico Campiglia. Blake may have also consulted the frontispiece engraving of the Farnese bust in Alexander Pope’s translation of <i>The Iliad</i> (1720) which Hayley owned  and the portrait engraving on the title page of John Flaxman’s outline illustrations of the <i>Iliad</i>(1793). There are numerous editions of Homer listed in Hayley’s 1772 manuscript catalogue and the 1821 auction catalogue, including Chapman’s famous edition although none contain Gregori’s engraving which may have been part of Hayley’s collection of “Poet’s Heads”.

       If Blake used Gregori’s engraving as a model, he altered the orientation of the head, retained the blank eyes, denoting blindness, the pursed lips, curly hair and beard, and the headband.

       The area between the third window and wall D was 1.2 m and could accommodate one portrait, such as Homer or Cowper. Both heads face to the right, thereby keeping the orientation of the heads uniform on wall C. In this configuration, the portrait of Cowper may have occupied this wall rather than the longer portrait of Homer. 
   </p><p>
Blake’s source for this portrait head was Romney’s pastel drawing of Cowper (1792).  In a letter to Lady Harriet Hesketh of 22 July 1800, Hayley describes having Romney’s portrait of Cowper adorning “the Library of my marine Turret”.  Blake copied Romney’s sketch for two portrait miniatures, a pen and ink drawing, a pencil sketch, and an engraving (https://blakearchive.org/copy/bb468.1?descId=bb468.1.comeng.01) for the first volume of Hayley’s <i>The Life, and Posthumous Writings, of William Cowper</i> (1803).

  <p><br/>
  The area between the second and third window was also 1.8 m. The portraits of Dryden and Pope are of similar lengths and face to the right. In the Osborn plan, these two portraits face each other but the orientation of the heads in the extant portraits suggest they were next to each other.
</p><p>
Blake’s source for Pope derives from Jean-Baptiste van Loo’s portrait, which was copied by numerous engravers during the eighteenth century, including Jacobus Houbraken, whose version was published in Thomas Birch’s <i>Heads of Illustrious Persons of Great Britain</i> (1741). Hayley’s 1772 ms catalogue and the 1821 auction catalogue do not include Birch’s publication. There are 6 editions of Pope’s works listed in the 1772 ms catalogue and 10 editions listed in the 1821 catalogue.  While none of these editions contain an engraving after van Loos, Hayley also owned John Bell’s 68-volume <i>The Poets of Great Britain</i>, which includes an engraving after van Loo signed Cook and dated 12 January 1778. 
</p><p>
Blake’s portrait of Dryden derives from George Vertue’s engraving of Godfrey Kneller’s portrait of Dryden. A copy of this portrait is in Trinity College, Cambridge, which Hayley attended. Vertue’s engraving after Kneller is in <i>The Dramatick Works of John Dryden</i> (1725), which Hayley owned.

       <p><br/>

       The area between the first and second windows was 1.8 m and could accommodate more than one portrait. It is possible that the portraits of Camõens, Ercilla and Thomas Alphonso occupied this area. These are the three smallest portraits and face to the right. The similarity of sizes between Ercilla and Thomas Alphonso portraits, as well as their depiction in profile, suggest they complement each other. The central location may also have influenced the choice of these portraits. This area of wall C would have been immediately viewable from the doorway leading to Hayley’s bedchamber and the doorway leading to the turret staircase. Therefore, Hayley would have seen Blake’s portrait of his son as soon as he entered the library, either from his bedchamber or from the stairs.
   </p><p>
The source for Camõens was the anonymous frontispiece to the 1655 edition of <i>The Luisad</i>, translated by Richard Fanshaw, which depicts the Portuguese poet with his left eye closed to signify blindness.  In all the reproductions of Blake’s portrait published in the twentieth century, however, Camõens is depicted with both eyes open, with the left eye slightly larger than the right.  The removal of varnish and oil-based paint by conservators at the Manchester City Art Gallery reveals that in the original tempera Camõens was depicted the left eye closed. This confirms that Blake’s source for the portrait was the 1655 edition of <i>The Luisad</i> and that another hand had used oil paint to amend the portrait.  The repainting of Camõens probably occurred between 1863 and the sale of the 18 portrait heads to the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1885. In his catalogue of Blake’s paintings appended to the second volume of the first edition of Gilchrist’s biography (1863), William Michael Rossetti describes Camõens as “Undisguisedly one-eyed”.  The second edition (1880) reprints Rossetti’s description from the first edition. By the time the series was sold to the Manchester City Art Gallery, Camõens had both eyes open. 
</p><p>
The source for Ercilla was Manuel Salvador Carmon’s engraved bust published in the second volume of <i>Parnaso Español</i>, 9 vols (1768-78). Hayley owned the first seven volumes and in <i>An Essay on Epic Poetry</i> (1781) provides the first English translation of a section from Ercilla’s poem, Araucana.   
</p><p>
The source for Thomas Alphonso Hayley was John Flaxman’s medallion portrait of his pupil. The medallion was sketched by Henry Howard and engraved by Blake to illustrate Hayley’s <i>Essay on Sculpture</i> (1800).

     <p><br/>

     The first painting on wall C would have been another long portrait also facing to the right, such as the head of Dante, occupying the area above the bookcase between wall B and the first window. Blake’s portrait of Dante derives from Raphael’s <i>Disputa</i> (1509-10) and possibly <i>Il Parnaso</i> (1509-11). Engravings of these frescos were in circulation during the period and the 1821 auction catalogue records several editions of the Divine Comedy, including the 1791 three-volume edition published in Rome with an engraved vignette on the title page depicting Dante in profile sporting laurels.  In his notes to <i>An Essay on Epic Poetry</i>, Hayley provides one of the earliest known English translations of the first three cantos of the <i>Inferno</i> and refers to the famous Paolo and Francesca and Ugolino episodes.

    Raimondi’s engraving is after an early drawing of <i>Il Parnaso</i> prior to Raphael’s completion of the fresco in the Vatican. Apollo occupies the center of the composition surrounded by the nine muses. To the left, Dante and Virgil stand either side of Homer, an arrangement that invokes canto 4 of <i>The Inferno</i>. While there are other figures in the composition sporting laurel crowns, they aren’t clearly identifiable in this early version. In the finished fresco, as Giorgio Vasari observed, Raphael incorporates “all the most famous and modern poets who ever lived or were still alive”.

    <p><br/>
    The two longest portraits, Cicero and Demosthenes, would have occupied the area above the bookcases on walls A and B, either side of the chimneybreast. Both heads face the same direction, to the right.
</p><p>
Blake’s portrait of Cicero derives from the frontispiece engraving by M. Burg after Rubens in <i>Aeshines et Demosthenes de Corono</i> (1715). Hayley owned several editions of this publication including the 1715 edition.   This edition also includes an engraving of the bust of Demosthenes by Berg but Blake based his portrait on D. Beyet’s 1789 engraving.

    Blake closely follows Beyet’s engraving, depicting Demosthenes facing leftward, with blank eyes, curly beard and hair. Based on the similarities between the engraving and Blake’s portrait, it is likely that Beyet’s print was part of Hayley’s collection of “Poet’s Heads”.

   <p><br/>
   Blake’s portraits of Otway and Klopstock would have occupied positions along wall I, opposite the window in wall C. Both portraits face to the left and are noticeably darker tonally than the portraits on walls A, B, C and D, suggesting that they were executed with the intention of being in direct sunlight. 
</p><p>
Blake’s source for Klopstock was Johann Gerhard Huck’s mezzotint after Anton Hickel. Hayley’s friend, William Meyer, son of the miniaturist Jeremiah, sent Hayley “a recent print of Klopstock to add to your collection of Poet’s Heads” in October 1800.  This print may have been Huck’s mezzotint. 
</p><p>
Blake’s source for Otway was I. Miller’s portrait engraving after Mary Beale in <i>The Works of Thomas Otway</i> (1757). Hayley owned several copies of Otway’s <i>Works</i> including the 1757 edition.

        c. 1800-03. Pen and tempera on canvas. The City Art Gallery, Manchester.
        <p><br/>
    At least three portraits would have been located on wall G. The area between wall F and the door to the main bedchamber in wall G was 1.5 m in length. This area could accommodate both the Shakespeare and Voltaire portraits, which face left and therefore maintain the orientation pattern. There is perhaps some irony in a hanging arrangement that places France’s most famous eighteenth-century critic next to the subject of some of his more inflammatory strictures, with the suggestion that Voltaire’s attacks and (mis)translations fail to harm the bard. The area between the bedchamber door and wall H is also 1.5 m, which would allow a portrait such as Tasso, again with the head orientated to the left, to occupy this space.
</p><p>
Blake based his portrait of Tasso on the engraving by N. Depuis after Seeman that appears as the frontispiece to Jacob Tonson’s two-volume <i>Gierusalemme Liberate</i> (1724). A copy of this publication was in Hayley’s library.   
</p><p>
For the head of Voltaire, Blake drew on one or more of the numerous engravings after Maurice Quentin de Latour’s portrait. While Hayley owned several editions of Voltaire’s letters and writings, none contain a portrait engraving. It is likely that a portrait engraving of Voltaire after Latour was in Hayley’s collection of “Poets Heads”. 
</p><p>
For the head of Shakespeare, Blake followed the famous frontispiece engraving by Martin Droeshout published in the first folio (1623). According to Hayley’s manuscript list of Portraits of English Poets, he owned a portrait of Shakespeare.

            <p><br/>
    
    The portraits of Chaucer and Spenser are tonally darker and would fit the area above the bookcases on wall E. The orientation of the heads, facing to the left, would ensure that apart from the Milton portrait, there would be a continuous pattern of leftward orientation in all the portraits.
</p><p>
Blake’s portrait of Spencer derives from George Vertue’s engraving in his series “Twelve Celebrated English Poets”. Spencer is listed in Hayley’s Portraits of English Poets, which suggests Vertue’s portrait engraving was part of Hayley’s collection of ‘Poet’s Heads”.
</p><p>
Blake’s source of Chaucer was Vertue’s engraved portrait in <i>The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</i> (1721), which was present in Hayley’s library.
