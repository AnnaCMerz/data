					Begin with Tharmas Parent power. darkning in the West<br/>
				
				
					Lost! Lost! Lost! are my Emanations Enion O Enion<br/>
						
					We are become a Victim to the Living We hide in secret<br/>
						
					I have hidden Jerusalem in Silent Contrition O Pity Me<br/>
						
					I will build thee a Labyrinth also O pity me O Enion <br/>
						
					Why hast thou taken sweet Jerusalem from my inmost Soul <br/>
						
					Let her Lay secret in the Soft recess of darkness &amp; silence<br/>

					It is not Love I bear to <br/>
						[Jerusalem]<br/>
						It is Pity <br/>
						
					She hath taken refuge in my bosom &amp; I cannot cast her out.
				
				
					The Men have recieved their death wounds &amp; their Emanations are fled <br/>
					To me for refuge &amp; I cannot turn them out for Pitys sake<br/>
				
				
					Enion said—Thy fear has made me tremble thy terrors have surrounded me<br/>
						
					All Love is lost Terror succeeds &amp; Hatred instead of Love<br/>
					And stern demands of Right &amp; Duty instead of Liberty.
					Once thou wast to Me the loveliest son of heaven—But now <br/>
 <br/>
				
				
					Why art thou Terrible and yet I love thee in thy terror till<br/>
					I am almost Extinct &amp; soon shall be a Shadow in Oblivion<br/>
					Unless some way can be found that I may look upon thee &amp; live<br/>

					Hide me some Shadowy semblance. secret whispring in my Ear<br/>
					In secret of soft wings. in mazes of delusive beauty <br/>
					I have lookd into the secret soul of him I lovd<br/>
					And in the Dark recesses found Sin &amp; cannot return<br/>
				
				
					Trembling &amp; pale sat Tharmas weeping in his clouds<br/>
					
					Why wilt thou Examine every little fibre of my soul<br/>
					Spreading them out before the Sun like Stalks of flax to dry <br/>
					The infant joy is beautiful but its anatomy<br/>
					Horrible Ghast &amp; Deadly nought shalt thou find in it<br/>
					But Death Despair &amp; Everlasting brooding Melancholy<br/>
				
				
					Thou wilt go mad with horror if thou dost Examine thus<br/>
					Every moment of my secret hours Yea I know <br/>
					That I have sinnd &amp; that my Emanations are become harlots<br/>
					I am already distracted at their deeds &amp; if I look<br/>
					Upon them more Despair will bring self murder on my soul<br/>
					O Enion thou art thyself a root growing in hell<br/>
					Tho thus heavenly beautiful to draw me to destruction<br/>
				
				
					Sometimes I think thou art a flower expanding<br/>
					Sometimes I think thou art fruit breaking from its bud<br/>
					In dreadful dolor &amp; pain &amp; I am like an atom<br/>
					A Nothing left in darkness yet I am an identity<br/>
					I wish &amp; feel &amp; weep &amp; groan Ah terrible terrible<br/>

					In Eden,Females sleep the winter in soft silken veils <br/>
						
					Woven by their own hands to hide them in the darksom grave<br/>
					But Males immortal live renewd by female deaths. in soft<br/>
					Delight they die &amp; they revive in spring with music &amp; songs<br/>

					Enion said Farewell I die I hide. from thy searching eyes<br/>
				
				
					So saying—From her bosom weaving soft in Sinewy threads<br/>
					A tabernacle for Jerusalem she sat among the Rocks<br/>
						
					Singing her lamentation. Tharmas groand among his Clouds<br/>
					Weeping, then bending from his Clouds he stoopd his innocent head<br/>
						
					And stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep sublime<br/>
					Turnd round the circle of Destiny with tears &amp; bitter sighs<br/>

					And said. Return O Wanderer when the Day of Clouds is oer<br/>
				
				
					So saying he sunk down into the sea a pale white corse<br/>
					In torment he sunk down &amp; flowd among her filmy Woof<br/>
						
					His Spectre issuing from his feet in flames of fire<br/>
					In gnawing pain drawn out by her lovd fingers every nerve <br/>
						
					She counted. every vein &amp; lacteal threading them among<br/>
					Her woof of terror. Terrified &amp; drinking tears of woe<br/>
					Shuddring she wove—nine days &amp; nights Sleepless her food was tears<br/>
					Wondring she saw her woof begin to animate. &amp; not<br/>
					As Garments woven subservient to her hands but having a will<br/>
					Of its own perverse &amp; wayward Enion lovd &amp; wept<br/>
				
				
					Nine days she labourd at her work. &amp; nine dark sleepless nights<br/>

					But on the tenth trembling morn the Circle of Destiny Complete<br/>
						
					Round rolld the Sea Englobing in a watry Globe self balancd<br/>
					
					A Frowning Continent appeard Where Enion in the Desart<br/>
					Terrified in her own Creation viewing her woven shadow<br/>
					Sat in a dread intoxication of Repentance &amp; Contrition<br/>
						
				
				
					There is from Great Eternity a mild &amp; pleasant rest<br/>
					Namd Beulah a Soft Moony Universe feminine lovely <br/>
					Pure mild &amp; Gentle given in Mercy to those who sleep<br/>
					Eternally. Created by the Lamb of God around<br/>
					On all sides within &amp; without the Universal Man<br/>
					The Daughters of Beulah follow sleepers in all their Dreams<br/>
						
					Creating Spaces lest they fall into Eternal Death<br/>
				
				
					The Circle of Destiny complete they gave to it a Space<br/>
					And namd the Space Ulro &amp; brooded over it in care &amp; love<br/>

					They said The Spectre is in every man insane &amp; most<br/>
					Deformd Thro the three heavens descending in fury &amp; fire<br/>

					We meet it with our Songs &amp; loving blandishments &amp; give<br/>

					To it a form of vegetation But this Spectre of Tharmas<br/>
					Is Eternal Death What shall we do O God pity &amp; help <br/>
						
					So spoke they &amp; closd the Gate of the Tongue in trembling fear <br/>
						
				
				
					What have I done! said Enion accursed wretch! What deed.
						
					Is this a deed of Love I know what I have done. I know<br/>
					Too late now to repent. Love is changd to deadly Hate <br/>
						
					A <br/>

					I see the Shadow of the dead within my Soul wandering <br/>
						
					In darkness &amp; solitude forming Seas of Doubt &amp; rocks of Repentance<br/>
						
					Already are my Eyes reverted. all that I behold<br/>
					Within my Soul has lost its splendor &amp; a brooding Fear<br/>
					Shadows me oer &amp; drives me outward to a world of woe<br/>
					So waild she trembling before her own Created Phantasm<br/>

					The first state weeping they began &amp; helpless as a wave<br/>
					Beaten along its sightless way growing enormous in its motion to<br/>

					Raisd the bright boy &amp; girl with glories from their heads out beaming <br/>
						
					Drawing forth drooping mothers pity drooping mothers sorrow <br/>
						
				
				
					They sulk upon her breast her hair became like snow on mountains<br/>
						
					Weaker &amp; weaker, weeping woful, wearier and wearier<br/>

					And then they wanderd far away she sought for them in vain<br/>
						
					In weeping blindness stumbling she followd them oer rocks &amp; mountains<br/>

					Rehumanizing from the Spectre in pangs of maternal love<br/>
					Ingrate they wanderd scorning her drawing her Spectrous Life<br/>
					Repelling her away &amp; away by a dread repulsive power <br/>
					Into Non Entity revolving round in dark despair.
					And drawing in the Spectrous life in pride and haughty joy<br/>
						
					Thus Enion gave them all her spectrous life<br/>
						
				
				
					Then Eno a daughter of Beulah took a Moment of Time <br/>
						
					And drew it out to Seven thousand years with much care &amp; affliction<br/>
						
					And many tears &amp; in Every year made windows into Eden <br/>
						
					
					She also took an atom of space &amp; opend its center<br/>
					Into Infinitude &amp; ornamented it with wondrous art<br/>
					Astonishd sat her Sisters of Beulah to see her soft affections<br/>
					To Enion &amp; her children &amp; they ponderd these things wondring <br/>

					And they Alternate kept watch over the Youthful terrors<br/>
					They saw not yet the Hand Divine for it was not yet reveald<br/>
					But they went on in Silent Hope &amp; Feminine repose<br/>
				
				
					But Los &amp; Enitharmon delighted in the Moony spaces of Eno <br/>
						
					Nine Times they livd among the forests, feeding on sweet fruits<br/>

					And nine bright Spaces wanderd weaving mazes of delight<br/>
					Snaring the wild Goats for their milk they eat the flesh of Lambs<br/>

					A male &amp; female naked &amp; ruddy as the pride of summer<br/>
					Alternate Love &amp; Hate his breast; hers Scorn &amp; Jealousy<br/>

					In embryon passions. they kiss'd not nor embrac'd for shame &amp; fear<br/>

					He could controll the times &amp; seasons, &amp; the days &amp; years<br/>
					She could controll the spaces, regions, desart, flood &amp; forest<br/>

					But had no power to weave a Veil of covering for her Sins<br/>
					She drave the Females all away from Los<br/>
					And Los drave all the Males from her away<br/>
					They wanderd long, till they sat down upon the margind sea.
					Conversing with the visions of Beulah in dark slumberous bliss<br/>
						
				
				
					But the two youthful wonders wanderd in the world of Tharmas<br/>
						
					Thy name is Enitharmon; said the fierce prophetic boy<br/>

					But Enitharmon answerd with a dropping tear &amp; frowning<br/>
						
					Dark as a dewy morning when the crimson light appears <br/>
						
					To make us happy let them weary their immortal powers <br/>
						
					While we draw in their sweet delights while we return them scorn<br/>
						
					On scorn to feed our discontent; for if we grateful prove<br/>
					They will withhold sweet love, whose food is thorns &amp; bitter roots.
					We hear the warlike clarions we view the turning spheres<br/>
						
					Yet Thou in indolence reposest holding me in bonds<br/>
					Hear! I will sing a Song of Death! it is a Song of Vala!
						
					The Fallen Man takes his repose: Urizen sleeps in the porch<br/>
						
					Luvah and Vala woke &amp; flew up from the Human Heart<br/>
						
					Into the Brain; from thence upon the pillow Vala slumber'd.
					And Luvah siez'd the Horses of Light, &amp; rose into the Chariot of Day<br/>
					Sweet laughter siezd me in my sleep! silent &amp; close I laughd<br/>
						
					For in the visions of Vala I walkd with the mighty Fallen One <br/>
						
					I heard his voice among the branches, &amp; among sweet flowers.
						
					
					Why is the light of Enitharmon darken'd in dewy morn<br/>
						
					Why is the silence of Enitharmon a terror &amp; her smile a whirlwind<br/>
						
					Uttering this darkness in my halls, in the pillars of my Holy-ones<br/>

					Why dost thou weep as Vala? &amp; wet thy veil with dewy tears,
						
					In slumbers of my night-repose, infusing a false morning?
					Driving the Female Emanations all away from Los <br/>
						
					I have refusd to look upon the Universal Vision<br/>
					And wilt thou slay with death him who devotes himself to thee<br/>
						
					Once born for the sport &amp; amusement of Man now born to drink up all his Powers<br/>

					I heard the sounding sea; I heard the voice weaker and weaker;
					The voice came &amp; went like a dream, I awoke in my sweet bliss.

					Then Los smote her upon the Earth twas long eer she revivd<br/>
					He answer'd, darkning more with indignation hid in smiles<br/>
						
				
				
					I die not Enitharmon tho thou singst thy Song of Death<br/>
						
					Nor shalt thou me torment For I behold the Fallen Man<br/>
						
					Seeking to comfort Vala, she will not be comforted<br/>
						
					She rises from his throne and seeks the shadows of her garden<br/>
					Weeping for Luvah lost, in the bloody beams of your false morning<br/>

					Sickning lies the Fallen Man his head sick his heart faint<br/>
						
					Mighty atchievement of your power! Beware the punishment<br/>
					I see, invisible descend into the Gardens of Vala<br/>
					Luvah walking on the winds, I see the invisible knife<br/>
					I see the shower of blood: I see the swords &amp; spears of futurity<br/>

					Tho in the Brain of Man we live, &amp; in his circling Nerves. <br/>

					Tho' this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain.
					Where Urizen &amp; all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps<br/>
					Thou neer shalt leave this cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns<br/>

				
				
					So spoke Los. Scorn &amp; Indignation rose upon Enitharmon<br/>
					Then Enitharmon reddning fierce stretchd her immortal hands <br/>
						
				
				
					Descend O Urizen descend with horse &amp; chariots<br/>
					Threaten not me O visionary thine the punishment<br/>
					The Human Nature shall no more remain nor Human acts<br/>
					Form the rebellious Spirits of Heaven. but War &amp; Princedom &amp; Victory &amp; Blood<br/>

					Night darkend as she spoke! a shuddring ran from East to West<br/>
						
					A Groan was heard on high. The warlike clarions ceast. the Spirits <br/>

					Of Luvah &amp; Vala shudderd in their Orb: an orb of blood! <br/>
						
				
				
					Eternity groand &amp; was troubled at the Image of Eternal Death<br/>

					The Wandering Man bow'd his faint head and Urizen descended<br/>
					And the one must have murderd the other if he had not descended <br/>
						
					
					Indignant muttering low thunders; Urizen descended<br/>
					Gloomy sounding, Now I am God from Eternity to Eternity<br/>
				
				
					Sullen sat Los plotting Revenge. Silent he eye'd the Prince <br/>
						
					Of Light. Silent the prince of Light viewd Los. at length a brooded<br/>
						
					Smile broke from Urizen for Enitharmon brightend more &amp; more<br/>

					Sullen he lowerd on Enitharmon but he smild on Los<br/>
				
				
					Saying Thou art the Lord of Luvah into thine hands I give<br/>
					The prince of Love the murderer his soul is in thine hands<br/>
					Pity not Vala for she pitied not the Eternal Man <br/>
					Nor pity thou the cries of Luvah. Lo these starry hosts<br/>
					They are thy servants if thou wilt obey my awful Law<br/>
				
				
					Los answerd furious art thou one of those who when most complacent<br/>

					Mean mischief most. If you are such Lo! I am also such<br/>
					One must be master. try thy Arts I also will try mine<br/>
					For I percieve Thou hast Abundance which I claim as mine<br/>
				
				
					Urizen startled stood but not Long soon he cried<br/>
					Obey my voice young Demon I am God from Eternity to Eternity<br/>
					
						Thus Urizen spoke collected in himself in awful pride<br/>
					
					
						Art thou a visionary of Jesus the soft delusion of Eternity <br/>
						Lo I am God the terrible destroyer &amp; not the Saviour<br/>
						Why should the Divine Vision compell the sons of Eden<br/>
						to forego each his own delight to war against his Spectre <br/>
							
						The Spectre is the Man the rest is only delusion &amp; fancy<br/>
					
					
						So spoke the Prince of Light &amp; sat beside the Seat of Los<br/>
						Upon the sandy shore rested his chariot of fire<br/>
					
					
						Ten thousand thousand were his hosts of spirits on the wind:
						Ten thousand thousand glittering Chariots shining in the sky:
						They pour upon the golden shore beside the silent ocean.
						Rejoicing in the Victory &amp; the heavens were filld with blood<br/>
							
					
					
						The Earth spread forth her table wide. the Night a silver cup<br/>
						Fill'd with the wine of anguish waited at the golden feast<br/>
						But the bright Sun was not as yet; he filling all the expanse<br/>
						Slept as a bird in the blue shell that soon shall burst away<br/>
					
					
						Los saw the wound of his blow he saw he pitied he wept<br/>
							
						Los now repented that he had smitten Enitharmon he felt love<br/>
						Arise in all his Veins he threw his arms around her loins<br/>
						To heal the wound of his smiting<br/>

					The King of Light beheld her mourning among the Brick kilns compelld<br/>

					To labour night &amp; day among the fires, her lamenting voice<br/>
					Is heard when silent night returns &amp; the labourers take their rest<br/>
				
				
					O Lord wilt thou not look upon our sore afflictions<br/>
					Among these flames incessant labouring, our hard masters laugh <br/>
					At all our sorrow. We are made to turn the wheel for water<br/>
					To carry the heavy basket on our scorched shoulders, to sift<br/>
					The sand &amp; ashes, &amp; to mix the clay with tears &amp; repentance<br/>

					I see not Luvah as of old I only see his feet <br/>
						
					Like pillars of fire travelling thro darkness &amp; non entity <br/>

					
					The times are now returnd upon us, we have given ourselves<br/>
					To scorn and now are scorned by the slaves of our enemies<br/>
					Our beauty is coverd over with clay &amp; ashes, &amp; our backs<br/>

					Furrowd with whips, &amp; our flesh bruised with the heavy basket<br/>

					Forgive us O thou piteous one whom we have offended, forgive <br/>
					The weak remaining shadow of Vala that returns in sorrow to thee.

				
				
					Thus she lamented day &amp; night, compelld to labour &amp; sorrow<br/>

					Luvah in vain her lamentations heard; in vain his love<br/>
					Brought him in various forms before her still she knew him not<br/>

					Swallowing up the horrible din in agony on agony<br/>
					Thro the Confusion like a crack across from immense to immense <br/>

					Loud strong a universal groan of death louder<br/>
					Than all the wracking elements deafend &amp; rended worse<br/>

					But from the Dolorous Groan one like a shadow of smoke appeard<br/>
					And human bones rattling together in the smoke &amp; stamping<br/>
					The nether Abyss &amp; gnasshing in fierce despair. panting in sobs<br/>

					Thick short incessant bursting sobbing. deep despairing stamping struggling<br/>
					
					Struggling to utter the voice of Man struggling to take the features of Man. Struggling<br/>
						
					To take the limbs of Man at length emerging from the smoke<br/>
					Of Urizen dashed in pieces from his precipitant fall <br/>
					Tharms reard up his hands &amp; stood on the affrighted Ocean<br/>
					The dead reard up his Voice &amp; stood on the resounding shore<br/>

				
				
					Crying. Fury in my limbs. destruction in my bones &amp; marrow<br/>
					My skull riven into filaments. my eyes into sea jellies<br/>
					Floating upon the tide wander bubbling &amp; bubbling<br/>
					Uttering my lamentations &amp; begetting little monsters<br/>
					Who sit mocking upon the little pebbles of the tide<br/>
					In all my rivers &amp; on dried shells that the fish<br/>

					Have quite forsaken. O fool fool to lose my sweetest bliss<br/>
					Where art thou Enion ah too near to cunning too far off <br/>

					So Tharmas bellowd oer the ocean thundring sobbing bursting<br/>
					The bounds of Destiny were broken &amp; hatred now began <br/>
					Instead of love to Enion. Enion blind &amp; age bent<br/>
					Plungd into the cold billows living a life in midst of waters<br/>
					In terrors she witherd away to Entuthon Benithon<br/>
					A world of deep darkness where all things in horrors are rooted<br/>

				
				
					These are the words of Enion heard from the cold waves of despair<br/>

				
				
					O Tharmas I had lost thee. &amp; when I hoped I had found thee<br/>
					O Tharmas do not thou destroy me quite but let<br/>
					A little shadow. but a little showery form of Enion<br/>
					Be near thee loved Terror. let me still remain &amp; then do thou<br/>

					Thy righteous doom upon me. only let me hear thy voice <br/>
					Driven by thy rage I wander like a cloud into the deep<br/>
					Where never yet Existence came, there losing all my life<br/>
					I back return weaker &amp; weaker, consume me not away<br/>
					In thy great wrath. tho I have sinned. tho I have rebelld<br/>
					Make me not like the things forgotten as they had not been <br/>
					Make not the thing that loveth thee. a tear wiped away<br/>
				
				
					Tharmas replied riding on storms his voice of Thunder rolld <br/>
						
				
				
					Image of grief thy fading lineaments make my eyelids fail<br/>
					What have I done! both rage &amp; mercy are alike to me<br/>
					Looking upon thee Image of faint waters. I recoil<br/>
					
					From my fierce rage into thy semblance. Enion return<br/>
					Why does thy piteous face Evanish like a rainy cloud<br/>

					For now no more remaind of Enion in the dismal air<br/>

					Where Enion, blind &amp; age bent wanderd Ahania wanders now<br/>

					In strength &amp; brightness from the Abyss his bowels yearnd over them<br/>
					They rose in strength above the heaving deluge. in mighty scorn<br/>
					Red as the Sun in the hot morning of the bloody day<br/>

					And he said Wherefore do I feel such love &amp; pity<br/>
						
					Ah Enion Ah Enion Ah lovely lovely Enion<br/>
					How is this All my hope is gone for ever fled <br/>
						
					Like a famishd Eagle Eyeless raging in the vast expanse<br/>
					Incessant tears are now my food. incessant rage &amp; tears<br/>

					Are those who love. like those who died. risen again from death<br/>

					Los answerd in his furious pride sparks issuing from his hair<br/>
					Hitherto shalt thou come. no further. here thy proud waves cease<br/>

					We have drunk up the Eternal Man by our unbounded power <br/>

					Till on my silver bed I slept &amp; sweet dreams round me hoverd<br/>

					But now my land is darkend &amp; my wise men are departed<br/>
				
				
					My songs are turned to cries of Lamentation<br/>
						
					Heard on my Mountains &amp; deep sighs under my palace roofs <br/>
					Because the Steeds of Urizen once swifter than the light<br/>
					Were kept back from my Lord &amp; from his chariot of mercies<br/>
				
				
				
					O did I keep the horses of the day in silver pastures<br/>
					O I refusd the Lord of day the horses of his prince<br/>
					O did I close my treasuries with roofs of solid stone<br/>
					And darken all my Palace walls with envyings &amp; hate<br/>
				
				
					O Fool to think that I could hide from his all piercing eyes<br/>
					The gold &amp; silver &amp; costly stones his holy workmanship<br/>
					O Fool could I forget the light that filled my bright spheres<br/>
					Was a reflection of his face who calld me from the deep<br/>
				
				
					I well remember for I heard the mild &amp; holy voice<br/>
					Saying O light spring up &amp; shine &amp; I sprang up from the deep<br/>
						
					He gave to me a silver scepter &amp; crownd me with a golden crown<br/>

					&amp; said Go forth &amp; guide my Son who wanders on the ocean <br/>
						
				
				
					I went not forth. I hid myself in black clouds of my wrath <br/>

					We fell. I siezd thee dark Urthona In my left hand falling<br/>
				
				
					I siezd thee beauteous Luvah thou art faded like a flower<br/>

					But now thou art bound down with him even to the gates of hell<br/>
				
				
					Because thou gavest Urizen the wine of the Almighty <br/>
					For steeds of Light that they might run in thy golden chariot of pride<br/>
					I gave to thee the Steeds I pourd the stolen wine<br/>
					And drunken with the immortal draught fell from my throne sublime<br/>

					O horrible O dreadful state! those whom I loved best<br/>
					On whom I pourd the beauties of my light adorning them<br/>
					With jewels &amp; precious ornament labourd with art divine<br/>
					Vests of the radiant colours of heaven &amp; crowns of golden fire<br/>

					I gave sweet lillies to their breasts &amp; roses to their hair<br/>

					I taught them songs of sweet delight, I gave their tender voices<br/>

					Into the blue expanse &amp; I invented with laborious art<br/>
					Sweet instruments of sound. in pride encompassing my Knees<br/>
					They pourd their radiance above all. the daughters of Luvah Envied<br/>

					At their exceeding brightness &amp; the sons of eternity sent them gifts <br/>
					Now will I pour my fury on them &amp; I will reverse<br/>
					The precious benediction. for their colours of loveliness<br/>
					I will give blackness for jewels hoary frost for ornament deformity<br/>

					For crowns wreathd Serpents for sweet odors stinking corruptibility<br/>

					For voices of delight hoarse croakings inarticulate thro frost <br/>

					For labourd fatherly care &amp; sweet instruction. I will give<br/>
					Chains of dark ignorance &amp; cords of twisted self conceit<br/>
					And whips of stern repentance &amp; food of stubborn obstinacy<br/>
					That they may curse Tharmas their God &amp; Los his adopted son<br/>

				
				
				
					That they may curse &amp; worship the obscure Demon of destruction <br/>

					That they may worship terrors &amp; obey the violent<br/>

					His gloomy way before him Tharmas fled &amp; flying fought <br/>
				
				
					Crying. What &amp; who art thou Cold Demon. art thou Urizen<br/>
					Art thou like me risen again from death or art thou deathless<br/>
					If thou art he my desperate purpose hear &amp; give me death<br/>
					For death to me is better far than life. death my desire<br/>

					He could not take their fetters off for they grew from the soul<br/>

					Nor could he quench the fires for they flamd out from the heart<br/>

					Nor could he calm the Elements because himself was Subject<br/>
					So he threw his flight in terror &amp; pain &amp; in repentant tears<br/>

				
				
					When he had passd these southern terrors he approachd the East <br/>

					Void pathless beaten With iron sleet &amp; eternal hail &amp; rain<br/>
						
					No form was there no living thing &amp; yet his way lay thro<br/>
					This dismal world. he stood a while &amp; lookd back oer his former<br/>

					Terrific voyage. Hills &amp; Vales of torment &amp; despair<br/>
					Sighing &amp; Wiping a fresh tear. then turning round he threw <br/>

					Himself into the dismal void. falling he fell &amp; fell<br/>
					Whirling in unresistible revolutions down &amp; down<br/>
					In the horrid bottomless vacuity falling failing falling<br/>
					Into the Eastern vacuity the empty world of Luvah<br/>
				
				
					The ever pitying one who seeth all things saw his fall <br/>
					And in the dark vacuity created a bosom of clay<br/>
						
					When wearied dead he fell his limbs reposd in the bosom of slime<br/>

					As the seed falls from the sowers hand so Urizen fell &amp; death<br/>

					Shut up his powers in oblivion. then as the seed shoots forth<br/>
					In pain &amp; sorrow. So the slimy bed his limbs renewd<br/>
					At first an infant weakness. periods passd he gatherd strength<br/>
					But still in solitude he sat then rising threw his flight<br/>
					Onward tho falling thro the waste of night &amp; ending in death<br/>

					And in another resurrection to sorrow &amp; weary travel<br/>
					But still his books he bore in his strong hands &amp; his iron pen <br/>

					For when he died they lay beside his grave &amp; when he rose <br/>
						
					He siezd them with a gloomy smile for wrapd in his death clothes <br/>
						
					He hid them when he slept in death when he revivd the clothes<br/>
					Were rotted by the winds the books remaind still unconsumd<br/>
					
					Still to be written &amp; interleavd with brass &amp; iron &amp; gold <br/>
					Time after time for such a journey none but iron pens <br/>
					Can write And adamantine leaves recieve nor can the man who goes<br/>

					The journey obstinate refuse to write time after time<br/>
				
				
					Endless had been his travel but the Divine hand him led <br/>
						
					For infinite the distance &amp; obscurd by Combustions dire<br/>
					By rocky masses frowning in the abysses revolving erratic<br/>
					Round Lakes of fire in the dark deep the ruins of Urizens world<br/>
					Oft would he sit in a dark rift &amp; regulate his books<br/>
					Or sleep such sleep as spirits eternal wearied in his dark<br/>
					Tearful &amp; sorrowful state. then rise look out &amp; ponder<br/>
					His dismal voyage eyeing the next sphere tho far remote<br/>
					Then darting into the Abyss of night his venturous limbs <br/>
					Thro lightnings thunders earthquakes &amp; concussions fires &amp; floods<br/>
					Stemming his downward fall labouring up against futurity<br/>
					Creating many a Vortex fixing many a Science in the deep<br/>
					And thence throwing his venturous limbs into the Vast unknown<br/>
					Swift Swift from Chaos to chaos from void to void a road immense <br/>

				
				
					For when he came to where a Vortex ceasd to operate<br/>
					Nor down nor up remaind then if he turnd &amp; lookd back<br/>
					From whence he came twas upward all. &amp; if he turnd and viewd<br/>

					The unpassd void upward was still his mighty wandring<br/>
					The midst between an Equilibrium grey of air serene<br/>
					Where he might live in peace &amp; where his life might meet repose<br/>

				
				
					But Urizen said Can I not leave this world of Cumbrous wheels<br/>
					Circle oer Circle nor on high attain a void<br/>
					Where self sustaining I may view all things beneath my feet<br/>
					Or sinking thro these Elemental wonders swift to fall <br/>
					I thought perhaps to find an End a world beneath of voidness<br/>
					Whence I might travel round the outside of this Dark confusion<br/>
					When I bend downward bending my bead downward into the deep<br/>
					Tis upward all which way soever I my course begin<br/>
					But when A Vortex formd on high by labour &amp; sorrow &amp; care<br/>

					And weariness begins on all my limbs then sleep revives<br/>
					My wearied spirits waking then tis downward all which way<br/>
					So ever I my spirits turn no end I find of all<br/>
					O what a world is here unlike those climes of bliss<br/>
					Where my sons gatherd round my knees O thou poor ruind world <br/>

					Thou horrible ruin once like me thou wast all glorious<br/>
					And now like me partaking desolate thy masters lot<br/>
					Art thou O ruin the once glorious heaven are these thy rocks<br/>
					Where joy sang in the trees &amp; pleasure sported on the rivers<br/>

					And laughter sat beneath the Oaks &amp; innocence sported round<br/>
					Upon the green plains &amp; sweet friendship met in palaces<br/>
					And books &amp; instruments of song &amp; pictures of delight<br/>
					Where are they whelmd beneath these ruins in horrible destruction<br/>
						
					And if Eternal falling I repose on the dark bosom<br/>
					Of winds &amp; waters or thence fall into a Void where air<br/>
					Is not down falling thro immensity ever &amp; ever<br/>
					I lose my powers weakend every revolution till a death<br/>
					Shuts up my powers then a seed in the vast womb of darkness<br/>
					I dwell in dim oblivion. brooding over me the Enormous worlds<br/>
					Reorganize me shooting forth in bones &amp; flesh &amp; blood<br/>
					I am regenerated to fall or rise at will or to remain<br/>
					A labourer of ages a dire discontent a living woe<br/>
					Wandring in vain. Here will I fix my foot &amp; here rebuild<br/>
					Here Mountains of Brass promise much riches in their dreadful bosoms<br/>
						
				
				
					So he began to dig form<br/>

						of gold silver &amp; iron<br/>
						
					And brass vast instruments to measure out the immense &amp; fix<br/>

					The whole into another world better suited to obey<br/>
					His will where none should dare oppose his will himself being King<br/>

					Of All &amp; all futurity be bound in his vast chain <br/>
				
				
					And the Sciences were fixd &amp; the Vortexes began to operate<br/>
					On all the sons of men &amp; every human soul terrified<br/>
					At the turning wheels of heaven shrunk away inward withring away<br/>

					Gaining a New Dominion over all his sons &amp; Daughters<br/>
					&amp; over the Sons &amp; daughters of Luvah in the horrible Abyss <br/>

					For Urizen lamented over them in a selfish lamentation<br/>
					Till a white woof coverd his cold limbs from head to feet <br/>
						
					Hair white as snow coverd him in flaky locks terrific<br/>
					Overspreading his limbs. in pride he wanderd weeping<br/>
					Clothed in aged venerableness obstinately resolvd <br/>
					Travelling thro darkness &amp; whereever he traveld a dire Web<br/>
					Followd behind him as the Web of a Spider dusky &amp; cold<br/>
					Shivering across from Vortex to Vortex drawn out from his mantle of years<br/>
					A living Mantle adjoind to his life &amp; growing from his Soul<br/>

				
				
					And the Web of Urizen stre<br/>
						[t]<br/>
						chd direful shivring in clouds<br/>
					And uttering such woes such bursts such thunderings<br/>
						
					The eyelids expansive as morning &amp; the Ears<br/>
					As a golden ascent winding round to the heavens of heavens<br/>
					Within the dark horrors of the Abysses lion or tyger or scorpion<br/>

					For every one opend within into Eternity at will<br/>
					But they refusd because their outward forms were in the Abyss<br/>
				
				
				
					And the wing like tent of the Universe beautiful surrounding all<br/>

					Or drawn up or let down at the will of the immortal man<br/>
					Vibrated in such anguish the eyelids quiverd <br/>

					Pangs smote thro the brain &amp; a universal shriek<br/>
					Ran thro the Abysses rending the web torment on torment<br/>
				
				
					Thus Urizen in sorrows wanderd many a dreary way<br/>
					Warring with monsters of the Deeps in his most hideous pilgrimage<br/>

					Till his bright hair scatterd in snows his skin barkd oer with wrinkles<br/>

					Four Caverns rooting downwards their foundations thrusting forth<br/>

					The metal rock &amp; stone in ever painful throes of vegetation<br/>

					The Cave of Orc stood to the South a furnace of dire flames<br/>
					Quenchless unceasing. In the west the Cave of Urizen <br/>
					For Urizen fell as the Midday sun falls down into the West<br/>
					North stood Urthonas stedfast throne a World of Solid darkness<br/>
					Shut up in stifling obstruction rooted in dumb despair<br/>
					The East was Void. But Tharmas rolld his billows in ceaseless eddies<br/>

					Void pathless beat with Snows eternal &amp; iron hail &amp; rain<br/>
						
					All thro the caverns of fire &amp; air &amp; Earth, Seeking<br/>
					For Enions limbs nought finding but the black sea weed &amp; sickning slime<br/>
					Flying away from Urizen that he might not give him food<br/>
					Above beneath on all sides round in the vast deep of immensity<br/>
					That he might starve the sons &amp; daughters of Urizen on the winds <br/>

					Making between horrible chasms into the vast unknown<br/>
					All these around the world of Los cast forth their monstrous births<br/>

					But in Eternal times the Seat of Urizen is in the South <br/>
						
					Urthona in the North Luvah in East Tharmas in West<br/>
				
				
					And now he came into the Abhorred world of Dark Urthona<br/>
					By Providence divine conducted not bent from his own will<br/>
					Lest death Eternal should be the result for the Will cannot be violated<br/>

					Into the doleful vales where no tree grew nor river flowd<br/>
					Nor man nor beast nor creeping thing nor sun nor cloud nor star<br/>

					Still he with his globe of fire immense in his venturous hand<br/>
					Bore on thro the Affrighted vales ascending &amp; descending<br/>
					Oerwearied or in cumbrous flight he venturd oer dark rifts<br/>
					Or down dark precipices or climbd with pain and labour huge<br/>
					Till he beheld the world of Los from the Peaked rock of Urthona<br/>

					Redoubling his immortal efforts thro the narrow vales<br/>
					With difficulty down descending guided by his Ear<br/>
					And by his globe of fire he went down the Vale of Urthona <br/>
						
					Between the enormous iron walls built by the Spectre dark<br/>
				
				
				
					Dark grew his globe reddning with mists &amp; full before his path <br/>

					Striding across the narrow vale the Shadow of Urthona <br/>
						
					A spectre Vast appeard whose feet &amp; legs with iron scaled<br/>

						Tharmas stayd his flight &amp; stood in stern defiance<br/>
						
					Communing with the Spectre who rejoicd along the vale<br/>
					Round his loins a girdle glowd with many colourd fires<br/>
					In his hand a knotted Club whose knots like mountains frownd<br/>
					Desart among the Stars them withering with its ridges cold<br/>
					Black scales of iron arm the dread visage iron spikes instead<br/>
					Of hair shoot from his orbed scull. his glowing eyes<br/>
					Burn like two furnaces. he calld with Voice of Thunder<br/>
				
				
					Four winged heralds mount the furious blasts &amp; blow their trumps<br/>

					Gold Silver Brass &amp; iron clangors clamoring rend the shores <br/>
						
					Like white clouds rising from the Vales his fifty two armies<br/>
					From the four Cliffs of Urthona rise glowing around the Spectre<br/>

					Four sons of Urizen the Squadrons of Urthona led in arms<br/>
					Of gold &amp; silver brass &amp; iron he knew his mighty sons<br/>
				
				
					Then Urizen arose upon the wind back many a mile <br/>
					Retiring into his dire Web scattering fleecy snows<br/>
					As he ascended howling loud the Web vibrated strong<br/>
					From heaven to heaven from globe to globe. In vast excentric paths<br/>

					Compulsive rolld the Comets at his dread command the dreary way<br/>

					Falling with wheel impetuous down among Urthonas vales <br/>
					And round red Orc returning back to Urizen gorgd with blood<br/>
						
					Slow roll the massy Globes at his command &amp; slow oerwheel<br/>
					The dismal squadrons of Urthona. weaving the dire Web<br/>
					In their progressions &amp; preparing Urizens path before him<br/>

					Moulded to globes &amp; arrowy wedges rending thy bleeding limbs <br/>

					And now a whirling pillar of burning sands to overwhelm thee<br/>
					Steeping thy wounds in salts infernal &amp; in bitter anguish<br/>
					And now a rock moves on the surface of this lake of fire<br/>
					To bear thee down beneath the waves in stifling despair<br/>
					Pity for thee movd me to break my dark &amp; long repose <br/>
					And to reveal myself before thee in a form of wisdom<br/>

					Must war with secret monsters of the animating worlds<br/>
					O that I had not seen the day then should I be at rest<br/>
					Nor felt the stingings of desire nor longings after life<br/>
					For life is Sweet to Los the wretched to his winged woes <br/>
					Is given a craving cry that they may sit at night on barren rocks<br/>

					And whet their beaks &amp; snuff the air &amp; watch the opening dawn<br/>
					And Shriek till at the smells of blood they stretch their boney wings<br/>
					And cut the winds like arrows shot by troops of Destiny<br/>
				
				
					Thus Los lamented in the night unheard by Enitharmon <br/>
					For the Shadow of Enitharmon descended down the tree of Mystery<br/>

					The Spectre saw the Shade Shivering over his gloomy rocks<br/>
					Beneath the tree of Mystery which in the dismal Abyss<br/>
					Began to blossom in fierce pain shooting its writhing buds<br/>
					In throes of birth &amp; now the blossoms falling shining fruit<br/>

				
				
				
					Appeard of many colours &amp; of various poisonous qualities<br/>
					Of Plagues hidden in shining globes that grew on the living tree<br/>

				
				
					The Spectre of Urthona saw the Shadow of Enitharmon<br/>
					Beneath the Tree of Mystery among the leaves &amp; fruit<br/>
						
					Reddning the Demon strong prepard the poison of sweet Love <br/>
					He turnd from side to side in tears he wept &amp; he embracd<br/>
						
					The fleeting image &amp; in whispers mild wood the faint shade<br/>
				
				
					Loveliest delight of Men. Enitharmon shady hiding<br/>
					In secret places where no eye can trace thy watry way<br/>
					Have I found thee have I found thee tremblest thou in fear <br/>
					Because of Orc because he rent his discordant way<br/>
					From thy sweet loins of bliss. red flowd thy blood<br/>
					Pale grew thy face lightnings playd around thee thunders hoverd<br/>
						
					Over thee, &amp; the terrible Orc rent his discordant way<br/>
						
					But the next joy of thine shall be in sweet delusion<br/>
					And its birth in fainting &amp; sleep &amp; Sweet delusions of Vala <br/>
						
				
				
					The Shadow of Enitharmon answerd Art thou terrible Shade<br/>
					Set over this sweet boy of mine to guard him lest he rend<br/>

					Because in times of Everlasting I was rent in sunder<br/>

					How shall I flee how shall I flee into the tower of Los<br/>
					My feet are turned backward &amp; my footsteps slide in clay<br/>

					I never will depart from my great wrath<br/>
				
				
					So Tharmas waild wrathful then rode upon the Stormy Deep<br/>
						
					Cursing the Voice that mockd him with false hope in furious mood<br/>

					Then She returns swift as a blight upon the infant bud<br/>
					Howling in all the notes of woe to stay his furious rage <br/>
					Stamping the hills wading or swimming flying furious or falling<br/>

					Or like an Earthquake rumbling in the bowels of the earth<br/>
					Or like a cloud beneath &amp; like a fire flaming in high<br/>
					Walking in pleasure of the hills or murmuring in the dales<br/>
					Like to a rushing torrent beneath &amp; a falling rock above <br/>
					A thunder cloud in the south &amp; a lulling voice heard in the north<br/>
				
				
				
					And she went forth &amp; saw the forms of Life &amp; of delight<br/>

					Walking on Mountains or flying in the open expanse of heaven<br/>
					She heard sweet voices in the winds &amp; in the voices of birds<br/>

					That rose from waters for the waters were as the voice of Luvah<br/>

					Not seen to her like waters or like this dark world of death<br/>
					Tho all those fair perfections which men know only by name<br/>
					In beautiful substantial forms appeard &amp; served her<br/>
					As food or drink or ornament or in delightful works<br/>
					To build her bowers for the Elements brought forth abundantly<br/>
					The living soul in glorious forms &amp; every one came forth<br/>
					Walking before her Shadowy face &amp; bowing at her feet<br/>
					But in vain delights were poured forth on the howling melancholy<br/>

					For her delight the horse his proud neck bowd &amp; his white mane<br/>

					And the Strong Lion deignd in his mouth to wear the golden bit <br/>

					While the far beaming Peacock waited on the fragrant wind<br/>
					To bring her fruits of sweet delight from trees of richest wonders<br/>

					And the strong piniond Eagle bore the fire of heaven in the night season<br/>
					Wood &amp; subdud into Eternal Death the Demon Lay<br/>
					In rage against the dark despair. the howling Melancholy<br/>

					When In the Deeps beneath I gatherd of this ruddy fruit <br/>

					And must have given himself to death Eternal But<br/>
					Urthonas spectre in part mingling with him comforted him<br/>
					Being a medium between him &amp; Enitharmon But This Union<br/>

					Of six thousand Years of self denial and of bitter Contrition <br/>
						
				
				
					Urthonas Spectre terrified beheld the Spectres of the Dead<br/>
					Each Male formd without a counterpart without a concentering vision<br/>

					The Spectre of Urthona wept before Los Saying I am the cause<br/>
					That this dire state commences I began the dreadful state<br/>

					Los trembling answerd Now I feel the weight of stern repentance<br/>

					Tremble not so my Enitharmon at the awful gates<br/>
					Of thy poor broken Heart I see thee like a shadow withering<br/>
					As on the outside of Existence but look! behold! take comfort!
					Turn inwardly thine Eyes &amp; there behold the Lamb of God<br/>
					Clothed in Luvahs robes of blood descending to redeem<br/>
					O Spectre of Urthona take comfort O Enitharmon <br/>
					Couldst thou but cease from terror &amp; trembling &amp; affright<br/>

					When I appear before thee in forgiveness of ancient injuries<br/>
						
					Why shouldst thou remember &amp; be afraid. I surely have died in pain<br/>
					Often enough to convince thy jealousy &amp; fear &amp; terror<br/>
						
					Come hither be patient let us converse together because<br/>
						
					I also tremble at myself &amp; at all my former life<br/>
				
				
					Enitharmon answerd I behold the Lamb of God descending<br/>
					To Meet these Spectres of the Dead I therefore fear that he<br/>
						
					
					Will give us to Eternal Death fit punishment for such<br/>
					Hideous offenders Uttermost extinction in eternal pain<br/>

					So Enitharmon spoke trembling &amp; in torrents of tears<br/>

					Where the Spectrous dead wail &amp; sighing thus he spoke to Enitharmon<br/>

				
				
					Lovely delight of Men Enitharmon shady refuge from furious war<br/>
						
					Thy bosom translucent is a soft repose for the weeping souls<br/>
					Of those piteous victims of battle there they sleep in happy obscurity<br/>

					They feed upon our life we are their victims. Stern desire<br/>
					I feel to fabricate embodied semblances in which the dead<br/>
					May live before us in our palaces &amp; in our gardens of labour<br/>
						
					Which now opend within the Center we behold spread abroad<br/>
					To form a world of Sacrifice of brothers &amp; sons &amp; daughters <br/>
						
					To comfort Orc in his dire sufferings<br/>
						[;]<br/>
						look<br/>
						[!]<br/>
						my fires enlume afresh<br/>
					Before my face ascending with delight as in ancient times<br/>
				
				
					Enitharmon spread her beaming locks upon the wind &amp; said <br/>
					O Lovely terrible Los wonder of Eternity O Los my defence &amp; guide <br/>
						
					Thy works are all my joy. &amp; in thy fires my soul delights<br/>
					If mild they burn in just proportion &amp; in secret night<br/>
					And silence build their day in shadow of soft clouds &amp; dews<br/>

					Then I can sigh forth on the winds of Golgonooza piteous forms<br/>
					That vanish again into my bosom but if thou my Los<br/>
					Wilt in sweet moderated fury. fabricate forms sublime <br/>
						
					Such as the piteous spectres may assimilate themselves into<br/>
					They shall be ransoms for our Souls that we may live<br/>
				
				
					So Enitharmon spoke &amp; Los his hands divine inspired began <br/>
						
					To modulate his fires studious the loud roaring flames<br/>
					He vanquishd with the strength of Art bending their iron points<br/>

					And drawing them forth delighted upon the winds of Golgonooza <br/>
						
					From out the ranks of Urizens war &amp; from the fiery lake<br/>
					Of Orc bending down as the binder of the Sheaves follows <br/>
					The reaper in both arms embracing the furious raging flames<br/>
					Los drew them forth out of the deeps planting his right foot firm<br/>

					Upon the Iron crag of Urizen thence springing up aloft<br/>
					Into the heavens of Enitharmon in a mighty circle<br/>
				
				
					And first he drew a line upon the walls of shining heaven<br/>
					And Enitharmon tincturd it with beams of blushing love<br/>
				
				
				
					It remaind permanent a lovely form inspird divinely human<br/>
					Dividing into just proportions Los unwearied labourd<br/>
					The immortal lines upon the heavens till with sighs of love<br/>
					Sweet Enitharmon mild Entrancd breathd forth upon the wind <br/>
					The spectrous dead Weeping the Spectres viewd the immortal works<br/>

					Of Los Assimilating to those forms Embodied &amp; Lovely<br/>
					In youth &amp; beauty in the arms of Enitharmon mild reposing<br/>
				
				
					First Rintrah &amp; then Palamabron drawn from out the ranks of war<br/>
					In infant innocence reposd on Enitharmons bosom <br/>
					Orc was comforted in the deeps his soul revivd in them<br/>
					As the Eldest brother is the fathers image So Orc became<br/>
						
					As Los a father to his brethren &amp; he joyd in the dark lake<br/>
					Tho bound with chains of Jealousy &amp; in scales of iron &amp; brass<br/>
				
				
					But Los loved them &amp; refusd to Sacrifice their infant limbs <br/>

					And Enitharmons smiles &amp; tears prevaild over self protection<br/>

					They rather chose to meet Eternal death than to destroy<br/>
					The offspring of their Care &amp; Pity Urthonas spectre was comforted<br/>

					But Tharmas most rejoicd in hope of Enions return<br/>
					For he beheld new Female forms born forth upon the air<br/>
					Who wove soft silken veils of covering in sweet rapturd trance<br/>
					Mortal &amp; not as Enitharmon without a covering veil<br/>
				
				
					First his immortal spirit drew Urizen<br/>
						[s]<br/>
						Shadow away<br/>
						
					From out the ranks of war separating him in sunder<br/>
					Leaving his Spectrous form which could not be drawn away <br/>
					Then he divided Thiriel the Eldest of Urizens sons<br/>
					Urizen became Rintrah Thiriel became Palamabron<br/>
					Thus dividing the powers of Every Warrior<br/>
					Startled was Los he found his Enemy Urizen now<br/>
					In his hands. he wonderd that he felt love &amp; not hate <br/>

					Forgotten when one speaks of thee he will not be believd <br/>
					When the man gently fades away in his immortality<br/>
				
				
				
					When the mortal disappears in improved knowledge cast away<br/>
					The former things so shall the Mortal gently fade away<br/>
					And so become invisible to those who still remain<br/>
					Listen I will tell thee what is done in the caverns of the grave <br/>

					The Lamb of God has rent the Veil of Mystery soon to return<br/>
					In Clouds &amp; Fires around the rock &amp; the Mysterious tree<br/>
					As the seed waits Eagerly watching for its flower &amp; fruit<br/>
					Anxious its little soul looks out into the clear expanse<br/>
					To see if hungry winds are abroad with their invisible army <br/>
					So Man looks out in tree &amp; herb &amp; fish &amp; bird &amp; beast<br/>

					Collecting up the scatterd portions of his immortal body<br/>
					Into the Elemental forms of every thing that grows<br/>
					He tries the sullen north wind riding on its angry furrows<br/>
					The sultry south when the sun rises &amp; the angry east <br/>
					When the sun sets when the clods harden &amp; the cattle stand<br/>
					Drooping &amp; the birds hide in their silent nests. he stores his thoughts<br/>
					As in a store house in his memory he regulates the forms<br/>
					Of all beneath &amp; all above &amp; in the gentle West<br/>
					Reposes where the Suns heat dwells he rises to the Sun<br/>
					And to the Planets of the Night &amp; to the stars that gild<br/>
					The Zodiac &amp; the stars that sullen stand to north &amp; south<br/>

					He touches the remotest pole &amp; in the Center weeps<br/>
					That Man should Labour &amp; sorrow &amp; learn &amp; forget &amp; return<br/>
					To the dark valley whence he came to begin his labours anew<br/>
					In pain he sighs in pain he labours in his universe<br/>
					Screaming in birds over the deep &amp; howling in the Wolf<br/>
					Over the slain &amp; moaning in the cattle &amp; in the winds<br/>
					And weeping over Orc &amp; Urizen in clouds &amp; flaming fires<br/>
						
					And in the cries of birth &amp; in the groans of death his voice <br/>

					Is heard throughout the Universe whereever a grass grows<br/>
					Or a leaf buds The Eternal Man is seen is heard is felt<br/>
					And all his Sorrows till he reassumes his ancient bliss<br/>
				
				
					Such are the words of Ahania &amp; Enion. Los hears &amp; weeps <br/>
						
					And Los &amp; Enitharmon took the Body of the Lamb <br/>
					Down from the Cross &amp; placd it in a Sepulcher which Los had hewn<br/>
					For himself in the Rock of Eternity trembling &amp; in despair<br/>
						
					Jerusalem wept over the Sepulcher two thousand Years<br/>

					Rahab triumphs over all she took Jerusalem<br/>
					Captive A Willing Captive by delusive arts impelld<br/>

					Upon the bloody Altar. John Saw these things Reveald in Heaven<br/>
					On Patmos Isle &amp; heard the Souls cry out to be deliverd <br/>
				
				
				
					He saw the Harlot of the Kings of Earth &amp; saw her Cup<br/>
					Of fornication food of Orc &amp; Satan pressd from the fruit of Mystery<br/>

					But when she saw the form of Ahania weeping on the Void<br/>
					And heard Enions voice sound from the caverns of the Grave<br/>
					No more spirit remained in her She secretly left the Synagogue of Satan<br/>
					She commund with Orc in secret She hid him with the flax<br/>
					That Enitharmon had numberd away from the Heavens <br/>
						
					She gatherd it together to consume her Harlot Robes<br/>
						
					In bitterest Contrition sometimes Self condemning repentant<br/>
					And Sometimes kissing her Robes &amp; jewels &amp; weeping over them <br/>
					Sometimes returning to the Synagogue of Satan in Pride<br/>
					And Sometimes weeping before Orc in humility &amp; trembling<br/>
					The Synagogue of Satan therefore uniting against Mystery<br/>
					Satan divided against Satan resolvd in open Sanhedrim<br/>
					To burn Mystery with fire &amp; form another from her ashes <br/>
					For God put it into their heart to fulfill all his will<br/>

					Which to their Phantom Eyes appear'd still in the Sepulcher<br/>
					But Jesus stood beside them in the Spirit Separating<br/>
					Their Spirit from their body. Terrified at Non Existence <br/>
					For such they deemd the death of the body. Los his vegetable hands<br/>

					Outstretchd his right hand branching out in fibrous Strength<br/>
					Siezd the Sun. His left hand like dark roots coverd the Moon<br/>
					And tore them down cracking the heavens across from immense to immense<br/>

					Then fell the fires of Eternity with loud &amp; shrill <br/>

					O Prince of Light where art thou I behold thee not as once<br/>

					O how couldst thou deform those beautiful proportions <br/>

					Let Luvah rage in the dark deep even to Consummation<br/>
					For if thou feedest not his rage it will subside in peace<br/>
				
				
				
					But if thou darest obstinate refuse my stern behest<br/>
					Thy crown &amp; scepter I will sieze &amp; regulate all my members<br/>

					In stern severity &amp; cast thee out into the indefinite<br/>

					Weeping at the threshold of Existence I will steel my heart<br/>
					Against thee to Eternity &amp; never recieve thee more<br/>

					Into confused perturbation &amp; strife &amp; honour &amp; pride<br/>

					Is a deceit so detestable that I will cast thee out<br/>
					If thou repentest not &amp; leave thee as a rotten branch to be burnd<br/>
					With Mystery the Harlot &amp; with Satan for Ever &amp; Ever<br/>
					Error can never be redeemd in all Eternity<br/>

					So Urizen spoke he shook his snows from off his Shoulders &amp; arose<br/>

					The fleecy white renewd he shook his aged mantles off<br/>
					Into the fires Then glorious bright Exulting in his joy<br/>

					In radiant Youth. when Lo like garlands in the Eastern sky<br/>
					When vocal may comes dancing from the East Ahania came<br/>
					Exulting in her flight as when a bubble rises up<br/>
					On to the surface of a lake. Ahania rose in joy<br/>
					Excess of joy is worse than grief—her heart beat high her blood<br/>
					Burst its bright Vessels She fell down dead at the feet of Urizen<br/>

					Outstretchd a Smiling corse they buried her in a silent cave<br/>
					Urizen dropt a tear the Eternal Man Darkend with sorrow<br/>
				
				
					The three daughters of Urizen Guard Ahanias Death couch <br/>

							He turnd the horses loose &amp; laid his Plow in the northern corner<br/>

							Of the wide Universal field. then Stepd forth into the immense<br/>
								
						
						
							Then he began to sow the seed he girded round his loins<br/>
							With a bright girdle &amp; his skirt filld with immortal souls<br/>
							Howling &amp; Wailing fly the souls from Urizens strong hand <br/>
						
						
							For from the hand of Urizen the myriads fall like stars<br/>
							Into their own appointed places driven back by the winds<br/>
							The naked warriors rush together down to the sea shores<br/>
							They are become like wintry flocks like forests stripd of leaves<br/>

							The Kings &amp; Princes of the Earth cry with a feeble cry <br/>
							Driven on the unproducing sands &amp; on the hardend rocks<br/>
							And all the while the flames of Orc follow the ventrous feet<br/>
							Of Urizen &amp; all the while the Trump of Tharmas sounds<br/>
							Weeping &amp; wailing fly the souls from Urizens strong hand<br/>
							The daughters of Urizen stand with Cups &amp; measures of foaming wine<br/>
							Immense upon the heavens with bread &amp; delicate repasts<br/>
						
						
							Then follows the golden harrow in the midst of Mental fires<br/>
							To ravishing melody of flutes &amp; harps &amp; softest voice<br/>
							The seed is harrowd in while flames heat the black mould &amp; cause<br/>

							The human harvest to begin Towards the south first sprang <br/>
							The myriads &amp; in silent fear they look out from their graves<br/>

						
						
							Then Urizen sits down to rest &amp; all his wearied Sons<br/>
							Take their repose on beds they drink they sing they view the flames<br/>

							Of Orc in joy they view the human harvest springing up<br/>
							A time they give to sweet repose till all the harvest is ripe<br/>
						
						
							And Lo like the harvest Moon Ahania cast off her death clothes<br/>
							She folded them up in care in silence &amp; her brightning limbs<br/>

							Bathd in the clear spring of the rock then from her darksom cave<br/>

							Issud in majesty divine Urizen rose up from his couch<br/>
							On wings of tenfold joy clapping his hands his feet his radiant wings<br/>
							In the immense as when the Sun dances upon the mountains<br/>
							A shout of jubilee in lovely notes responding from daughter to daughter<br/>

							From son to Son as if the Stars beaming innumerable<br/>
						
						
						
							Thro night should sing soft warbling filling Earth &amp; heaven<br/>

							And bright Ahania took her seat by Urizen in songs &amp; joy <br/>
						
						
							The Eternal Man also sat down upon the Couches of Beulah<br/>
							Sorrowful that he could not put off his new risen body<br/>
							In mental flames the flames refusd they drove him back to Beulah<br/>

							His body was redeemd to be permanent thro Mercy Divine<br/>

							And now fierce Orc had quite consumd himself in Mental flames<br/>
							Expending all his energy against the fuel of fire<br/>
							The Regenerate Man stoopd his head over the Universe &amp; in <br/>
								
							His holy hands recievd the flaming Demon &amp; Demoness of Smoke<br/>

							And gave them to Urizens hands the Immortal frownd Saying<br/>
						
						
							Luvah &amp; Vala henceforth you are Servants obey &amp; live<br/>
							You shall forget your former state return O Love in peace <br/>
								
							Into your place the place of seed not in the brain or heart<br/>
							If Gods combine against Man Setting their Dominion above<br/>
							The Human form Divine. Thrown down from their high Station <br/>
							In the Eternal heavens of Human Imagination: buried beneath <br/>
								
							In dark Oblivion with incessant pangs ages on ages<br/>
							In Enmity &amp; war first weakend then in stern repentance<br/>
							They must renew their brightness &amp; their disorganizd functions<br/>

							Again reorganize till they resume the image of the human<br/>
							Cooperating in the bliss of Man obeying his Will<br/>
							Servants to the infinite &amp; Eternal of the Human form<br/>
						
						
							Luvah &amp; Vala descended &amp; enterd the Gates of Dark Urthona<br/>

							And walkd from the hands of Urizen in the shadows of Valas Garden<br/>

							Where the impressions of Despair &amp; Hope for ever vegetate<br/>
							In flowers in fruits in fishes birds &amp; beasts &amp; clouds &amp; waters<br/>
							The land of doubts &amp; shadows sweet delusions unformd hopes<br/>
							They saw no more the terrible confusion of the wracking universe<br/>

							They heard not saw not felt not all the terrible confusion<br/>
							For in their orbed senses within closd up they wanderd at will <br/>

							And those upon the Couches viewd them in the dreams of Beulah<br/>
							As they reposd from the terrible wide universal harvest<br/>
							Invisible Luvah in bright clouds hoverd over Valas head<br/>
							And thus their ancient golden age renewd for Luvah spoke<br/>
							With voice mild from his golden Cloud upon the breath of morning <br/>

						
						
							Come forth O Vala from the grass &amp; from the silent Dew<br/>
							Rise from the dews of death for the Eternal Man is Risen<br/>
						
						
							She rises among flowers &amp; looks toward the Eastern clearness<br/>

							She walks yea runs her feet are wingd on the tops of the bending grass<br/>
							Her garments rejoice in the vocal wind &amp; her hair glistens with dew<br/>
						
						
						
							She answerd thus Whose voice is this in the voice of the nourishing air<br/>
							In the spirit of the morning awaking the Soul from its grassy bed<br/>

							Where dost thou dwell for it is thee I seek &amp; but for thee<br/>

							Where dost thou flee O fair one where dost thou seek thy happy place<br/>

						
						
							To yonder brightness there I haste for sure I came from thence<br/>
							Or I must have slept eternally nor have felt the dew of morning<br/>
						
						
							Eternally thou must have slept nor have felt the morning dew <br/>
							But for yon nourishing sun tis that by which thou art arisen<br/>
							The birds adore the sun the beasts rise up &amp; play in his beams<br/>

							And every flower &amp; every leaf rejoices in his light<br/>
							Then O thou fair one sit thee down for thou art as the grass<br/>
							Thou risest in the dew of morning &amp; at night art folded up <br/>

						
						
							Alas am I but as a flower then will I sit me down<br/>
							Then will I weep then Ill complain &amp; sigh for immortality<br/>
							And chide my maker thee O Sun that raisedst me to fall<br/>
						
						
							So saying she sat down &amp; wept beneath the apple trees<br/>
						
						
							O be thou blotted out thou Sun that raisedst me to trouble <br/>
							That gavest me a heart to crave &amp; raisedst me thy phantom<br/>
							To feel thy heat &amp; see thy light &amp; wander here alone<br/>
							Hopeless if I am like the grass &amp; so shall pass away<br/>

							Yon Sun shall wax old &amp; decay but thou shalt ever flourish <br/>

							But thou shalt still survive arise O dry thy dewy tears<br/>
						
						
							Hah! Shall I still survive whence came that sweet &amp; comforting voice<br/>
							And whence that voice of sorrow O sun thou art nothing now to me<br/>

							Go on thy course rejoicing &amp; let us both rejoice together <br/>
							I walk among his flocks &amp; hear the bleating of his lambs<br/>
							O that I could behold his face &amp; follow his pure feet<br/>
							I walk by the footsteps of his flocks come hither tender flocks<br/>

							Can you converse with a pure Soul that seeketh for her maker<br/>
							You answer not then am I set your mistress in this garden <br/>

							For from my pleasant hills behold the living living springs<br/>
							Running among my green pastures delighting among my trees<br/>
							I am not here alone my flocks you are my brethren<br/>
							And you birds that sing &amp; adorn the sky you are my sisters<br/>

							Of a curld Ram who stretchd himself in sleep beside his mistress<br/>

							My Luvah smild I kneeled down he laid his hand on my head<br/>
							And when he laid his hand upon me from the gates of sleep I came<br/>

							Into this bodily house to tend my flocks in my pleasant garden<br/>
						
						
							So saying she arose &amp; walked round her beautiful house<br/>
							And then from her white door she lookd to see her bleating lambs <br/>

							But her flocks were gone up from beneath the trees into the hills<br/>

						
						
							I see the hand that leadeth me doth also lead my flocks<br/>
							She went up to her flocks &amp; turned oft to see her shining house<br/>

							She stopd to drink of the clear spring &amp; eat the grapes &amp; apples<br/>
						
						
						
							She bore the fruits in her lap she gatherd flowers for her bosom<br/>

							She called to her flocks saying follow me O my flocks<br/>
						
						
							They followd her to the silent vall<br/>
								[e]<br/>
								y beneath the spreading trees<br/>
							And on the rivers margin she ungirded her golden girdle<br/>
							She stood in the river &amp; viewd herself within the watry glass<br/>

							And her bright hair was wet with the waters She rose up from the river<br/>
							And as she rose her Eyes were opend to the world of waters<br/>
							She saw Tharmas sitting upon the rocks beside the wavy sea<br/>
							He strokd the water from his beard &amp; mournd faint thro the summer vales<br/>
						
						
							And Vala stood on the rocks of Tharmas &amp; heard his mournful voice<br/>
						
						
							O Enion my weary head is in the bed of death <br/>
							For weeds of death have wrapd around my limbs in the hoary deeps<br/>

							I sit in the place of shells &amp; mourn &amp; thou art closd in clouds<br/>
							When will the time of Clouds be past &amp; the dismal night of Tharmas<br/>

							Arise O Enion Arise &amp; smile upon my head<br/>
								
							As thou dost smile upon the barren mountains and they rejoice <br/>
							When wilt thou smile on Tharmas O thou bringer of golden day<br/>
							Arise O Enion arise for Lo I have calmd my seas<br/>
						
						
							So saying his faint head he laid upon the Oozy rock<br/>
							And darkness coverd all the deep the light of Enion faded<br/>
							Like a fa<br/>

							Then Vala lifted up her hands to heaven to call on Enion<br/>
							She calld but none could answer her &amp; the Eccho of her voice returnd<br/>
						
						
							Where is the voice of God that calld me from the silent dew<br/>
							Where is the Lord of Vala dost thou hide in clefts of the rock<br/>
							Why shouldst thou hide thyself from Vala from the soul that<br/>

							And now her feet step on the grassy bosom of the ground<br/>
							Among her flocks &amp; she turnd her eyes toward her pleasant house<br/>

							And saw in the door way beneath the trees two little children playing<br/>

							She drew near to her house &amp; her flocks followd her footsteps <br/>

							The Children clung around her knees she embracd them &amp; wept over them<br/>
						
						
							Thou little Boy art Tharmas &amp; thou bright Girl Enion<br/>
							How are ye thus renewd &amp; brought into the Gardens of Vala<br/>
						
						
							She embracd them in tears. till the sun descended the western hills<br/>

							And then she enterd her bright house leading her mighty children <br/>

						
						
						
							And when night came the flocks laid round the house beneath the trees<br/>
							She laid the Children on the beds which she saw prepard in the house<br/>

							O my sweet Children Enion let Tharmas kiss thy Cheek<br/>
							Why dost thou turn thyself away from his sweet watry eyes<br/>
							Tharmas henceforth in Valas bosom thou shalt find sweet peace<br/>
							O bless the lovely eyes of Tharmas &amp; the Eyes of Enion <br/>
						
						
							They rose they went out wandring sometimes together sometimes alone<br/>

						
						
							Why weepest thou Tharmas Child of tears in the bright house of joy<br/>

							Doth Enion avoid the sight of thy blue heavenly Eyes<br/>
							And dost thou wander with my lambs &amp; wet their innocent faces<br/>
								
							With thy bright tears because the steps of Enion are in the gardens <br/>

							Arise sweet boy &amp; let us follow the path of Enion<br/>
						
						
							So saying they went down into the garden among the fruits<br/>
							And Enion sang among the flowers that grew among the trees<br/>
							And Vala said Go Tharmas weep not Go to Enion<br/>

							He said O Vala I am sick &amp; all this garden of Pleasure<br/>
							Swims like a dream before my eyes but the sweet smelling fruit<br/>
							Revives me to new deaths I fade even like a water lilly<br/>
							In the suns heat till in the night on the couch of Enion<br/>
							I drink new life &amp; feel the breath of sleeping Enion <br/>
							But in the morning she arises to avoid my Eyes<br/>
							Then my loins fade &amp; in the house I sit me down &amp; weep<br/>
						
						
							Chear up thy Countenance bright boy &amp; go to Enion<br/>
							Tell her that Vala waits her in the shadows of her garden<br/>
						
						
							He went with timid steps &amp; Enion like the ruddy morn <br/>
							When infant spring appears in swelling buds &amp; opening flowers<br/>

							Behind her Veil withdraws so Enion turnd her modest head<br/>
						
						
							But Tharmas spoke Vala seeks thee sweet Enion in the shades<br/>
							Follow the steps of Tharmas O thou brightness of the gardens<br/>
							He took her hand reluctant she followd in infant doubts <br/>
						
						
						
							Thus in Eternal Childhood straying among Valas flocks<br/>
							In infant sorrow &amp; joy alternate Enion &amp; Tharmas playd<br/>
							Round Vala in the Gardens of Vala &amp; by her rivers margin<br/>
							They are the shadows of Tharmas &amp; of Enion in Valas world<br/>
						
						
							And the sleepers who rested from their harvest work beheld these visions<br/>
							Thus were the sleepers entertaind upon the Couches of Beulah<br/>
						
						
							When Luvah &amp; Vala were closd up in their world of shadowy forms<br/>

							Darkness was all beneath the heavens only a little light<br/>

							Man is a Worm wearied with joy he seeks the caves of sleep<br/>
							Among the Flowers of Beulah in his Selfish cold repose<br/>
							Forsaking Brotherhood &amp; Universal love in selfish clay<br/>
							Folding the pure wings of his mind seeking the places dark<br/>
							Abstracted from the roots of Science then inclosd around<br/>
								
							In walls of Gold we cast him like a Seed into the Earth<br/>
							Till times &amp; spaces have passd over him duly every morn<br/>
							We visit him covering with a Veil the immortal seed<br/>
							With windows from the inclement sky we cover him &amp; with walls<br/>

							And hearths protect the Selfish terror till divided all <br/>

					O Mystery Fierce Tharmas cries Behold thy end is come<br/>

					Go down ye Kings &amp; Councellors &amp; Giant Warriors<br/>

					Where shall the graves recieve them all &amp; where shall be their place<br/>

					Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field<br/>
					Let him look up into the heavens &amp; laugh in the bright air<br/>
					Let the inchaind soul shut up in darkness &amp; in sighing <br/>
					Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years<br/>

					While the flail of Urizen sounded loud &amp; the winnowing wind of Tharmas<br/>
					So loud so clear in the wide heavens &amp; the song that they sung was this<br/>
					Composed by an African Black from the little Earth of Sotha<br/>

					How came I here Methinks I am as I was in my youth<br/>

					When in my fathers house I sat &amp; heard his chearing voice<br/>
					Methinks I see his flocks &amp; herds &amp; feel my limbs renewd<br/>

					And Lo my Brethren in their tents &amp; their little ones around them<br/>
				
				
					The song arose to the Golden feast the Eternal Man rejoicd<br/>
					Then the Eternal Man said Luvah the Vintage is ripe arise<br/>
					The sons of Urizen shall gather the vintage with sharp hooks<br/>
					And all thy sons O Luvah bear away the families of Earth<br/>
					I hear the flail of Urizen his barns are full no roo<br/>
						[m]<br/>
					Remains &amp; in the Vineyards stand the abounding sheaves beneath<br/>

					The falling Grapes that odorous burst upon the winds. Arise<br/>
					My flocks &amp; herds trample the Corn my cattle browze upon<br/>
					The ripe Clusters The shepherds shout for Luvah prince of Love<br/>
					Let the Bulls of Luvah tread the Corn &amp; draw the loaded waggon<br/>

					Into the Barn while children glean the Ears around the door<br/>
					Then shall they lift their innocent hands &amp; stroke his furious nose <br/>
					And he shall lick the little girls white neck &amp; on her head<br/>

					Scatter the perfume of his breath while from his mountains high<br/>

					The lion of terror shall come down &amp; bending his bright mane<br/>

					And couching at their side shall eat from the curld boys white lap<br/>

					His golden food and in the evening sleep before the Door <br/>
				
				
					Attempting to be more than Man We become less said Luvah<br/>
					As he arose from the bright feast drunk with the wine of ages<br/>
					His crown of thorns fell from his head he hung his living Lyre<br/>
					Behind the seat of the Eternal Man &amp; took his way<br/>
					Sounding the Song of Los descending to the Vineyards bright<br/>
					His sons arising from the feast with golden baskets follow<br/>
					A fiery train as when the Sun sings in the ripe vineyards<br/>
					Then Luvah stood before the wine press all his fiery sons<br/>
					Brought up the loaded Waggons with shoutings ramping tygers play<br/>

					In the jingling traces furious lions sound the song of joy <br/>
					To the golden wheels circling upon the pavement of heaven &amp; all<br/>
					The Villages of Luvah ring the golden tiles of the villages<br/>
				
				
				
					Reply to violins &amp; tabors to the pipe flute lyre &amp; cymbal<br/>

					Then fell the Legions of Mystery in maddning confusion<br/>
					Down Down thro the immense with outcry fury &amp; despair<br/>
					Into the wine presses of Luvah howling fell the Clusters<br/>
					Of human families thro the deep. the wine presses were filld<br/>
					The blood of life flowd plentiful Odors of life arose<br/>
					All round the heavenly arches &amp; the Odors rose singing this song<br/>

					O terrible wine presses of Luvah O caverns of the Grave<br/>
					How lovely the delights of those risen again from death<br/>
					O trembling joy excess of joy is like Excess of grief<br/>
				
				
					So sang the Human Odors round the wine presses of Luvah<br/>
				
				
					But in the Wine presses is wailing terror &amp; despair<br/>
					Forsaken of their Elements they vanish &amp; are no more<br/>
					No more but a desire of Being a distracted ravening desire<br/>
					Desiring like the hungry worm &amp; like the gaping grave<br/>
						
					They plunge into the Elements the Elements cast them forth<br/>
					Or else consume their shadowy semblance Yet they obstinate <br/>
					Tho pained to distraction Cry O let us Exist for<br/>
					This dreadful Non Existence is worse than pains of Eternal Birth<br/>
						
					Eternal Death who can Endure. let us consume in fires<br/>
					In waters stifling or in air corroding or in earth shut up<br/>
					The Pangs of Eternal birth are better than the Pangs of Eternal Death <br/>
				
				
					How red the Sons &amp; Daughters of Luvah how they tread the Grapes<br/>

					Laughing &amp; shouting drunk with odors many fall oerwearied<br/>
					Drownd in the wine is many a youth &amp; maiden those around<br/>
					Lay them on skins of tygers or the spotted Leopard or wild Ass<br/>
					Till they revive or bury them in cool Grots making lamentation <br/>

				
				
					But in the Wine Presses the Human Grapes Sing not nor dance<br/>
					They howl &amp; writhe in shoals of torment in fierce flames consuming<br/>

					In chains of iron &amp; in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires<br/>

					In pits &amp; dens &amp; shades of death in shapes of torment &amp; woe<br/>
					The Plates the Screws and Racks &amp; Saws &amp; cords &amp; fires &amp; floods<br/>
						
					The cruel joy of Luvahs daughters lacerating with knives<br/>
					And whip<br/>
						[s]<br/>
						their Victims &amp; the deadly sports of Luvahs Sons<br/>
						
				
				
					Timbrels &amp; Violins sport round the Wine Presses The little Seed<br/>

					The Sportive root the Earthworm the small beetle the wise Emmet<br/>

					Dance round the Wine Presses of Luvah. the Centipede is there<br/>
					The ground Spider with many Eyes the Mole clothed in Velvet<br/>
					The Earwig armd the tender maggot emblem of Immortality<br/>
					The Slow Slug the grasshopper that sings &amp; laughs &amp; drinks<br/>

					The winter comes he folds his slender bones without a murmur<br/>
					There is the Nettle that stings with soft down &amp; there<br/>
						
					
					The indignant Thistle whose bitterness is bred in his milk<br/>
					And who lives on the contempt of his neighbour there all the idle weeds<br/>
					That creep about the obscure places shew their various limbs<br/>
					Naked in all their beauty dancing round the Wine Presses<br/>
				
				
					They Dance around the Dying &amp; they Drink the howl &amp; groan<br/>

					They catch the Shrieks in cups of gold they hand them to one another<br/>

					These are the sports of love &amp; these the sweet delights of amorous play<br/>
					Tears of the grapes the death sweat of the Cluster the last sigh<br/>

					Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah<br/>
				
				
					The Eternal Man darkend with Sorrow &amp; a wintry mantle <br/>
					Coverd the Hills He said O Tharmas rise &amp; O Urthona<br/>
				
				
					Then Tharmas &amp; Urthona rose from the Golden feast satiated<br/>
					With Mirth &amp; joy Urthona limping from his fall on Tharmas leand<br/>

					In his right hand his hammer Tharmas held his Shepherds crook<br/>
					Beset with gold gold were the ornaments formed by the sons of Urizen <br/>

					Then Enion &amp; Ahania &amp; Vala &amp; the wife of Dark Urthona<br/>

					Rose from the feast in joy ascending to their Golden Looms<br/>
					There the wingd shuttle Sang the spindle &amp; the distaff &amp; the Reel<br/>
					Rang sweet the praise of industry. Thro all the golden rooms<br/>
					Heaven rang with winged Exultation All beneath howld loud<br/>
					With tenfold rout &amp; desolation roard the Chasms beneath<br/>
					Where the wide woof flowd down &amp; where the Nations are gatherd together<br/>
				
				
					Tharmas went down to the Wine presses &amp; beheld the sons &amp; daughters<br/>
					Of Luvah quite exhausted with the Labour &amp; quite filld<br/>
					With new wine. that they began to torment one another and to tread <br/>

					The weak. Luvah &amp; Vala slept on the floor o'erwearied<br/>
				
				
					Urthona calld his Sons around him Tharmas calld his sons<br/>
					Numrous. they took the wine they separated the Lees<br/>
					And Luvah was put for dung on the ground by the Sons of Tharmas &amp; Urthona<br/>
					They formed heavens of sweetest wo<br/>
						[o]<br/>
						d<br/>
						[s]<br/>
						of gold &amp; silver &amp; ivory <br/>
					Of glass &amp; precious stones They loaded all the waggons of heaven<br/>

					And took away the wine of ages with solemn songs &amp; joy<br/>
				
				
					Luvah &amp; Vala woke &amp; all the sons &amp; daughters of Luvah<br/>

					Awoke they wept to one another &amp; they reascended<br/>
					To the Eternal Man in woe he cast them wailing into<br/>
					The world of shadows thro the air till winter is over &amp; gone<br/>

				
				
					But the Human Wine stood wondering in all their delightful Expanses<br/>

					The Elements subside the heavens rolld on with vocal harmony<br/>
				
				
					Then Los who is Urthona rose in all his regenerate power<br/>
				
				
				
					The Sea that rolld &amp; foamd with darkness &amp; the shadows of death<br/>
					Vomited out &amp; gave up all the floods lift up their hands<br/>
					Singing &amp; shouting to the Man they bow their hoary heads<br/>
					And murmuring in their channels flow &amp; circle round his feet<br/>

					Then Dark Urthona took the Corn out of the Stores of Urizen<br/>
					He ground it in his rumbling Mills Terrible the distress<br/>
					Of all the Nations of Earth ground in the Mills of Urthona<br/>
					In his hand Tharmas takes the Storms. he turns the whirlwind Loose<br/>

					Upon the wheels the stormy seas howl at his dread command<br/>
					And Eddying fierce rejoice in the fierce agitation of the wheels<br/>

					Of Dark Urthona Thunders Earthquakes Fires Water floods<br/>
					Rejoice to one another loud their voices shake the Abyss<br/>
					Their dread forms tending the dire mills The grey hoar frost was there<br/>
					And his pale wife the aged Snow they watch over the fires<br/>
					They build the Ovens of Urthona Nature in darkness groans<br/>
					And Men are bound to sullen contemplations in the night<br/>
					Restless they turn on beds of sorrow. in their inmost brain<br/>
					Feeling the crushing Wheels they rise they write the bitter words<br/>

					Of Stern Philosophy &amp; knead the bread of knowledge with tears &amp; groans<br/>
				
				
					Such are the works of Dark Urthona Tharmas sifted the corn<br/>
					Urthona made the Bread of Ages &amp; he placed it<br/>
					In golden &amp; in silver baskets in heavens of precious stone<br/>
					And then took his repose in Winter in the night of Time<br/>
				
				
					The Sun has left his blackness &amp; has found a fresher morning <br/>

					And the mild moon rejoices in the clear &amp; cloudless night <br/>
						
					And Man walks forth from midst of the fires the evil is all consumd<br/>

					His eyes behold the Angelic spheres arising night &amp; day<br/>
					The stars consumd like a lamp blown out &amp; in their stead behold<br/>

					The Expanding Eyes of Man behold the depths of wondrous worlds<br/>
						
					One Earth one sea beneath nor Erring Globes wander but Stars<br/>
					Of fire rise up nightly from the Ocean &amp; one Sun<br/>
					Each morning like a New born Man issues with songs &amp; Joy<br/>
					Calling the Plowman to his Labour &amp; the Shepherd to his rest<br/>

					He walks upon the Eternal Mountains raising his heavenly voice <br/>

					Conversing with the Animal forms of wisdom night &amp; day<br/>
					That risen from the Sea of fire renewd walk oer the Earth<br/>
				
				
					For Tharmas brought his flocks upon the hills &amp; in the Vales<br/>

					Around the Eternal Mans bright tent the little Children play<br/>
					Among the wooly flocks The hammer of Urthona sounds<br/>
					In the deep caves beneath his limbs renewd his Lions roar<br/>
					Around the Furnaces &amp; in Evening sport upon the plains<br/>
					They raise their faces from the Earth conversing with the Man<br/>
				
				
				
					How is it we have walkd thro fires &amp; yet are not consumd<br/>
					How is it that all things are changd even as in ancient times<br/>

					The Sun arises from his dewy bed &amp; the fresh airs<br/>
					Play in his smiling beams giving the seeds of life to grow<br/>
					And the fresh Earth beams forth ten thousand thousand springs of life<br/>
					Urthona is arisen in his strength no longer now<br/>
					Divided from Enitharmon no longer the Spectre Los<br/>
					Where is the Spectre of Prophecy where the delusive Phantom<br/>
					Departed &amp; Urthona rises from the ruinous walls<br/>
					In all his ancient strength to form the golden armour of science<br/>

					For intellectual War The war of swords departed now<br/>
					The dark Religions are departed &amp; sweet Science reigns <br/>
