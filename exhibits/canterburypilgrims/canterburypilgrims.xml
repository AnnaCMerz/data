    <image dbi="Reeve Chaucer Clerk of Oxenford Cook 1-4" id="2">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Reeve">
          The Reeve appears at the far left of procession. His appearance makes him the most devious-looking in the group: his short hair is matted atop his prominent brow, he has a large hooked nose, his cheek is gaunt, and his lips are turned slightly upward in an ambiguous smile. His garment is vertically striped with a prominent collar or hood. He is framed by a Gothic-styled portal. The Reeve is smaller than the other pilgrims, thus furthest removed from the viewer. This also exaggerates the heft of Chaucer, riding in front of and to the right of the Reeve.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Chaucer">
          Chaucer is second from the left. Although shown in full profile, his head is turned slightly right, toward the viewer. His head covering identifies him as Chaucer: it is worn in nearly all portraits of him. However, this covering is white instead of the usual black. He appears to be engrossed in something other than the scene in front of him: his large eyes are open although his gaze is vacant and unfixed, and his lips are closed and slightly downturned. Details suggest his prominence: the collar, bottom hem, and sleeve cuffs of his gown are elaborately decorated and his physical heft denotes strength. He also carries religious ornaments, such as the string of ten prayer beads in his bare right hand, and travel necessities, such as the mat or blanket rolled up behind his back. The hem of the gown is wrinkled or swishing, suggesting movement forward. Chaucer sits on a dark horse that holds its downturned face and front left leg at a right angle and directs its gaze toward the Clerk’s horse.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Clerk of Oxenford">
          The Clerk of Oxenford appears third from the left. His long hair flows from beneath a dark, square cap. Like Chaucer, his wide, open eyes gaze forward, although his attention appears more fixed. His thin, straight eyebrows and tightly closed lips additionally suggest concentration. His gown mirrors the texture and color of Chaucer’s, although its decoration is more geometrical. He sits very erect on a light-colored horse. The horse appears haggard but its legs mirror those of Chaucer’s horse.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Cook">
          The cook appears fourth from the left, although only his upper torso, head, and raised hands are visible. His face is in profile and tilted back to drink what is presumably beer; he raises the tankard with his left hand and supports its weight with his right. His white cap, tied with a dark ribbon, covers any possible hair. A tall collar and ruffled sleeves decorate his garment. The cook’s appearance is more caricature than portraiture: his protruding brow, heavy-lidded eyes, snub nose, flaring nostril, and thick, pouting lips emphasize inebriation. 
      </caption>

    <image dbi="Miller Wife of Bath Merchant 5-7" id="3">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Miller">
          The miller is fifth from the left and one of the few African pilgrims. He turns slightly right but faces the viewer with large, open eyes. He has dark skin; dark, thick, tightly coiled hair; and a thick beard and mustache that flare outward. His thick, arched eyebrows and wide nose are prominent facial features. He holds the mouthpiece of a bagpipe with his large right hand; the bass drone extends over his left shoulder. He wears a simple long-sleeved tunic with a tall collar or hood clasped at the neck with a single button. 
      </caption>

      <caption title="Wife of Bath">
          Sixth from the left, the Wife of Bath rides sidesaddle and her whole body faces the viewer. Her sexuality is emphasized through slightly spread knees and breasts, with visible nipples, that swell out of her dress. Her posture and expression suggest relaxed ease: she looks upward and to the right with an open-mouthed smile and leans back in the saddle. She holds her horse’s reins and riding crop (with a decorative top shaped like a cock’s head) in one hand and a glass presumably filled with wine in the other. Her dress showcases her wealth: several adornments cover her head including a knitted bonnet and three elaborate collars that create a halo effect. The cone-shaped hat atop the second collar mimics the flourishes of the large, spiky collar extending outward from her shoulders. She wears long earrings and three strands of pearls around her neck and bare chest; the middle strand holds a cross and the bottom strand holds a large heart. Her white dress clings to her torso and waist and her lap is covered by a patterned blanket. She wears stockings and white elbow-length gloves. Her horse’s reins and mane are decorated with small bows and bells.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Merchant">
          Seventh from the left, the merchant observes the Wife of Bath. He appears exhausted: his long, gaunt face mirrors the taper of his thin, hooked nose and his eyes are nearly half closed. However, his raised eyebrows suggest surprise or alarm. His dark beard extends into two pointed tufts. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, an overcoat with a stiff, possibly braided collar, and a minimally embellished undershirt. Part of his horse’s face appears to the right of the parson.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Parson Man of Law and Plowman 8-10" id="4">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Parson">
          Eighth from the left, the Parson concentrates on the progress of the pilgrimage. He is in full profile facing right and stares directly ahead with open eyes and closed lips as he rides forward. His long, white hair and beard and his lined brow suggest age. He wears dark clothing including a circular hat with a small brim; a long, unadorned gown with upturned hems; and shoes with white laces. Simple bridling adorns his fairly shaggy, short-tailed horse, which slightly raises its back left and front right hoof, showing metal shoes. Its eyes are heavily lidded.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Man of Law">
          Ninth from the left, the Man of Law partially faces the viewer. His large, open eyes stare forward toward a distant scene. He has a shaggy, coarse white-gray beard and mustache and his hair peaks beneath a triangular, narrow-brimmed, tasseled hat. He wears possibly three layers of clothes, including an overcoat with split sleeves, a woven shirt, and a short lace collar. Aside from a bit of his right knee and leg, his lower body is mostly obscured by the Parson’s horse. His dark horse’s eyes are large, bright, and open and its ears are perked; its bit and reins are simple.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Plowman">
          The Plowman rides tenth from the left. Like the Parson, he stares ahead in full profile facing right. The Plowman has been compared by critics to Blake himself, a plowman in copper. The Plowman’s light-colored, woven hat has a wide, loose brim similar in style to the one worn by the traveler in plate 16 of For Children: the Gates of Paradise (1793). The Plowman’s shoulder-length hair falls out of his hat, his tan skin, angular face, and vein protruding on his neck all indicate outdoor labor. His haggard horse contrasts with the attentiveness of the Plowman and adjacent horses.
      </caption>

    <image dbi="Image4" id="5">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Physician">
          The Physician rides eleventh from the left, leftmost among four closely grouped pilgrims. His wide-open eyes and raised eyebrows express surprise as he faces forward in a three-quarter view. His elaborate hat is composed of a dark circular upper portion; a white fur brim; and two long ear flaps that mirror the long, columnar structure of his face and nose. His overcoat has a white fur trim and his undershirt has a geometric pattern. Although shaggy, his horse’s decorated rein matches the opulence of the Physician’s attire. It looks toward the Plowman’s horse.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Franklin">
          The Franklin rides twelfth from the left, second among the four closely grouped pilgrims. Unlike most of the other pilgrims, he gazes up. His horse and much of his body are obscured by the Physician but his wealth as a landowner is apparent: his voluminous white hair extends into an ample, well-trimmed beard; he wears a cap decorated with a large jewel and two white feathers; and his garment is decorated with an intricate pattern. His gloved hand holds the reins closely to his chest.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Two Citizens">
          Riding in the background, the thirteenth and fourteenth riders form a pair among the group of four pilgrims. Only their heads and upper torsos are visible. Both wear identical hats with rounded tops and upturned brims and, although more of the right citizen’s clothes are visible, both appear to wear a similar high-collared coat. However, their expressions differ: the leftmost citizen looks forward with raised brows and slightly parted lips while the rightmost citizen stares toward the viewer with slightly furrowed brows and pursed lips.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Shipman">
          Fifteenth from the left, the Shipman is the only figure to twist his body to look behind him. His gaze appears to meet that of the Plowman; together, they frame the group of four pilgrims. His left hand rests on his horse’s rump to support his body while the other extends, perhaps to hold reins. He has a dark, deeply tanned complexion; a long, dark beard; and dark, heavy brows that accentuate his scowl. He wears a round, fur-trimmed cap and a simple, woven garment.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Image5" id="6">

      <title>The Host</title>

      <caption>
          Sixteenth from the left, the Host commands attention for his central placement, hefty size, and grandiose gesture. He leans back against a rolled blanket (similar to Chaucer’s), turns his torso to face the viewer, and extends his arms perpendicularly in a cruciform posture. His oval-shaped face, double-chin, and form-fitting garment accentuate his portly physique. Like the Franklin, he wears a round hat with a central jewel and two feathers. Curly, light-colored hair is visible beneath. His raised brows and pursed lips ambiguously express either pleasure or concern as he gazes over his right shoulder. A wide ruffled collar, four clasps, and a belt holding a sword or dagger adorn his garment. He wears riding boots and holds a riding crop in his right hand and reins in the left. His dark, graceful horse lifts only its rear left hoof off the ground.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Image6" id="7">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Summoner">
          Seventeenth from the left, the Summoner turns in a three-quarter view to face the Pardoner. He has a dark complexion; heavy, dark brows turned upward; and a smile that accentuates his rounded face. A floral wreath or garland covers his head and a similar garland (or fur trim) is draped over his garment. His right arm bends at the elbow to reach toward the Pardoner; the fingers disappear behind the Pardoner’s waist in a sexually suggestive position. The shaft of a musical instrument extends from his right hand towards his right shoulder, where a mouthpiece is visible. Only the rump of his horse is visible. The Summoner may be a caricature of the Whig politician Charles James Fox (1749-1806).
      </caption>

      <caption title="Manciple">
          Riding in the background and only visible above the shoulders, the Manciple appears eighteenth from the left. His neck is turned sharply to look over his right shoulder and his gaze turns slightly upward. Downturned brows and tightly set lips suggest inquisitiveness. A circular feathered cap covers white hair that extends into a beard and mustache; the hair obscures his left ear. A lace collar shows beneath his garment.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Pardoner">
          Nineteenth from the left, the Pardoner twists his torso to the left to look behind him. Highly feminized details characterize his face, rendered in profile. He has long, light-colored hair that falls down his back; no facial hair; a small, triangular nose; a high forehead; and a receding chin. A long hood trails from his cap. His gown fits loosely, except for the sleeves. In addition to the cross on the back of his gown, on his bag, and on his horse’s bridle, he holds a large jeweled cross in his right hand. He places his left hand on his horse’s rump for support. The horse twists its head to the right, an opposite movement from that of its rider. The Pardoner’s horse is the only one to be shown with all four hooves on the ground, completely stopped. The Pardoner may be a caricature of William Pit the Younger (1759-1806), Tory politician and Prime Minister.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Monk">
          Twentieth from the right, the monk is seen in profile as he stares directly ahead and slightly upward. His head is large and round and his chin recedes into prominent jowls. White, curly hair circles his head, which is either nearly bald or tonsured. Like the Friar he wears a dark habit with a stiff circular hood; the rest of his body is obscured by the Pardoner’s horse. His left hand holds his horse’s reins tightly to his chest. Only his horse’s mane, decorated with bells, is visible.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Friar">
          The Friar, tenth from the right, turns toward the Monk on his right. Only his shoulders and head are visible. Like the Monk, he is bald or tonsured; his face is round and his chin recedes into his neck; and he wears a dark habit with a stiff circular hood. Unlike the Monk, he has a slight smile. He points with his left index finger toward the Monk or Pardoner.
      </caption>

      <caption title="A Citizen">
          Ninth from the right, a male citizen is shown in direct right profile. He resembles the two citizens riding behind him: he wears a hat with an upturned brim and a garment with tall lapels, and his shaggy hair extends into a beard and mustache. His brow is knitted, perhaps in contemplation of the journey ahead. His horse is not visible.
      </caption>

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Lady Abbess">
          The Lady Abbess is prominently featured in the foreground eighth from the right. She gazes slightly to the right with tightly closed lips. Her serene expression, delicate features, and elegant posture contrast with the female rider behind her, the Wife of Bath. Her light, long hair falls loosely down her back and she wears a crown with the sign of the cross that supports a long black veil. The white upper portion of her garment cinches at her upper arms and below her bosom, and a dark habit covers the rest of her body. Rosary beads decorated with ribbon and a medallion with the words “Amor Vincit Omnia” hang from her right wrist. She holds a riding crop in her right hand. Her horse is elaborately decorated: aside from the net covering draped over its body, the reins and bridle top are attractively detailed. Her horse’s elegant stride and gaze echo the composure of its rider. Two greyhounds play underneath: one strides forward in a gait that mirror the horse’s while the other jumps up to paw at the horse. Present in Chaucer’s original texts, these dogs also link the Lady Abbess with the mythological Diana, as noted by Warren Stevenson.[1]

      </caption>

      <caption title="Nun">
          The nun rides seventh from the right and turns her head directly toward the viewer. Older than her female companion, she has a round face, thick curly hair, and downturned eyes with heavy lids. A white wimple completely covers her neck and is also visible near the crown of her head. She wears a light-colored garment and, like the Lady Abbess, a black veil; it covers her shoulders and clasps over her chest. Her gloved right hand gestures toward the three priests to her left. Her horse’s head appears directly to the right of the Lady Abbess’ horse. Like its rider, it turns its head to look toward the viewer.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Three Priests">
          The group of three priests ride fourth, fifth, and sixth from the right. The leftmost of the group is shown in a three-quarter view and gazes upward with an entranced or contemplative expression. The raised circular hood of his habit emphasizes his round head. He has short, curly hair and a youthful appearance. The middle priest appears sterner: his face is gaunt and his dark hair, sizable beard, severe brows and tightly set lips create a stoic expression. He may be looking toward the Squire’s Yeoman. The rightmost in the group appears oldest and most dejected. Shown in right profile, his heavily lidded eyes, hooked nose, and downturned mouth emphasize the downward sag of his appearance. He has a white, bushy beard. The leftmost and rightmost priests have lightly colored, woven habits while the center priest has a dark habit with a light, braided edge.

      <title>Squire's Yeoman</title>

      <caption>
          The Squire’s Yeoman rides third from the right. His head is tilted back and turned sharply to the right to look at the viewer. He has a tan complexion and thick, curly hair. His large eyes, drooping lids, beard stubble, and sagging chin give him a tired appearance. His raised hood is attached to a garment that has a large brooch or gem in the front. His right hand, elaborately gloved with, perhaps, chainmail, holds a long, curved bow.
      </caption>

    <image dbi="Image9" id="10">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="The Knight">
          The Knight rides in the foreground second from the right. He twists his torso so his chest faces the viewer; his head is turned further to the right and shown in a three-quarter view. Although his face is covered with chainmail, his gray hair and beard are visible. He appears knowing and self-confident: he sits straight, his brows are slightly arched, and his lips are pressed together in a slight smile. The chainmail encircling his head and neck connects to a breastplate; below the breastplate, more chainmail extends over his hips and down his arms, and plated armor covers his right leg. Fabric is draped around his shoulders. Two more sashes cross his body: one across his chest supports a cross and another extends diagonally across his torso. The image of a horse and rider below the cross may be an additional emblem or it may be the hilt of his sword. His left hand holds his horse’s reins and his right hand gestures to the left with an open palm. His horse is minimally adorned except for the large jewel on its bridle and the netted covering over its haunches. Left of the horse a fierce, mangy black dog treads forward and stares directly ahead.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Squire">
          The Squire, first on the right side of the composition, leads the party. He sits taller than his companions and gazes slightly right of the viewer, perhaps surveying the path ahead. He wears a hat with two voluminous feathers over his tightly curled hair. He has a slight smile and a thin mustache above his lips. Stevenson describes his youthful appearance as “Apollonian.”[1] A decorated overcoat clasps at his neck and a lace collar shows underneath. Although the rider appears stoic, his horse is the most active of the procession: both of its front legs are raised off the ground in a forward gallop and its head is turned to face the viewer directly. Its front legs appear furthest to the right of the composition and demarcate the beginning of the procession.

      <caption>
In his Descriptive Catalogue, Blake lambasts Stothard’s portrayal of the Wife of Bath, a detail of which is seen here at right juxtaposed against Blake’s own version of the notorious female pilgrim at left. Blake discusses her character explicitly at two points in the text. In the first, he positions her in a binary relationship with the Lady Prioress as the representatives of the two classes of women. He asserts:
<blockquote>
Are not these leaders of the ages of men? The lady prioress, in some ages, predominates; and in some the Wife of Bath, in whose character Chaucer has been equally minute and exact; because she is also a scourge and a blight. I shall say no more of her, nor expose what Chaucer has left hidden; let the young reader study what he has said of her: it is useful as a scare-crow. There are of such characters born too many for the peace of the world.[1]
</blockquote>
 
Blake adorns his Wife of Bath with many signifiers to mark her loose sexuality, false piety, and preoccupation with worldly materials and power. Some of these signifying accoutrements include the cross necklace suspended between exposed breasts, the star-shaped spur visible above her right heel, the cock-headed riding crop clutched in her left hand, her sidesaddle riding position with legs at right and spread in the direction of the viewer, and her fickle beauty, revealed in a careful inspection of her buck teeth, sagging chin, and prominently hooked nose.
<br /><br />
 

Stothard’s Wife of Bath stands in stark contrast to Blake’s. Although she also rides sidesaddle with legs toward the viewer, her clothing is more conservative and understated in its solid patterning and style. A long skirt and long sleeves hide her limbs, while a wimple and hat cover her head, hair, and chin—a notable instance in which Stothard remains faithful to Chaucer’s description of the wimpled Wife of Bath and Blake departs from the text. Stothard’s Wife of Bath appears both young and her face quite comely as she looks playfully over her left shoulder at the pilgrims riding behind her. Her shirt, though modest in its coverage, accentuates her thin waist. Her youthful appearance incenses Blake, who rages in the Descriptive Catalogue about Stothard and his reviewer John Hoppner’s foolishness in both scholarship and art:

 
<blockquote>
In this manner he has jumbled his dumb dollies together, and is praised by his equals for it; for both himself and his friend are equally masters of Chaucer’s language. They both think that the Wife of Bath is a young beautiful blooming damsel; and H[oppner] says, that she is the Fair Wife of Bath, and that the Spring appears in her Cheeks. Now hear what Chaucer has made her say of herself, who is no modest one,
<br /><br />
‘But Lord when it rememberth me
<br />
Upon my youth and on my jollity,
<br />
It tickleth me about the heart root.
<br />
Unto this day it doth my heart boot,
<br />
That I have had my world as in my time;
<br />
But age, alas, that all will envenime,
<br />
Hath me bereft, my beauty and my pith
<br />
Let go; farewell: the devel go therewith,
<br />
The flower is gone, there is no more to tell.
<br />
The bran, as best, I can, I now mote sell;
<br />
And yet, to be right merry, will I fond,
<br />
Now forth to tell of my fourth husband.’[2]
</blockquote>
 
Instead of positioning her as a “scarecrow” for the edification of viewers as Blake does, Stothard portrays the Wife of Bath with no external markers of her flawed internal character, situating her instead in “a common scene” as described by Hoppner, which Blake hails as the most dangerous disguise possible for such a woman.

      <caption>
          In the Descriptive Catalogue accompanying the exhibition, Blake begins his detailed descriptions of the pilgrims with the Knight and the Squire, the two rightmost figures in his composition, a detail of which is visible here at left. His placement echoes Chaucer’s, he argues, who “has also placed them first in his prologue.”[1] Blake then launches into a laudatory account of the pair’s characters:
          <br />
          The Knight is a true Hero, a good, great, and wise man; his whole length portrait on horseback, as written by Chaucer, cannot be surpassed. He has spent his life in the field; has ever been a conqueror, and is that species of character which in every age stands as the guardian of man against the oppressor. His son [the Squire] is like him with the germ of perhaps greater perfection still, as he blends literature and the arts with his warlike studies. Their dress and their horses are of the first rate, without ostentation, and with all the true grandeur that unaffected simplicity when in high rank always displays.[2]
          <br />
          In accordance with Chaucer’s text, Blake depicts the mounted Knight in a full-length portrait in which the pilgrim wears the armor and accoutrements appropriate for a man who has spent his life conquering on the battlefield. In contrast, Stothard’s Knight (the second pilgrim visible from the left in the right detail) is crowded among other pilgrims and wears stylish civilian attire with a prominent large, black hat. Whereas Stothard’s Knight is shown in profile riding to the left, Blake’s Knight turns his torso back and to the left in the direction of the other pilgrims and extends his right hand toward them, perhaps in an instructive gesture to follow his lead. His posture is erect and stable, with only the slight fluttering of his scarf to suggest that he is moving forward. Behind him, the more youthful Squire gazes forward and slightly right, most likely in direct concentration on the path ahead.
          <br />
          Stothard positions his Knight and Squire as the seventh and ninth pilgrims, respectively, in his procession with the Reeve riding between them. Blake highlights what he believes to be Stothard’s erroneous departure from Chaucer’s text, asserting, “nothing need be done but to examine my rival’s prospectus. The two first characters in Chaucer, the Knight and the Squire, he has put among his rabble; and indeed his prospectus calls the Squire the fop of Chaucer’s age.”[3] Blake then quotes three sections of Chaucer’s introduction in which he lists various honorable qualities of the Squire and asks rhetorically after each: “Was this a fop?”[4]
          <br />
          Earlier in the Descriptive Catalogue, Blake observes that “Chaucer makes every one of his characters perfect in his kind, every one is an Antique Statue; the image of a class, and not of an imperfect individual.”[5] This particularity of Blake’s approach is evident in his treatment of the Squire whom he associates with Apollo. Unlike Stothard’s Squire who leans diagonally backward with torso turned to his right, hair blowing in the wind, as his horse lurches wildly beneath him, Blake’s Squire appears secure and even statuesque in his saddle as the horse below him charges forward with both front legs raised.

          In both compositions, Stothard and Blake position the Plowman on the more distant side of the procession from the viewer, obscuring all but the figure’s head and shoulders. Both Plowmen are shown in profile (though from opposite sides) with focused gazes directed at the path before them. Both are similarly attired: Blake’s Plowman on the left wears a wide-brimmed hat and a simple woven shirt while Stothard’s pilgrim sports an almost identical hat but also wears a protective neck covering that extends over his unadorned shirt. Although both Plowmen ride in the background, Blake delineates his figure with intricate linear detail, exemplified in the visible veins running up the Plowman’s neck in the engraving seen here, whereas Stothard’s Plowman is much less defined in his original painting and also faint in the later engraved reproduction.
          <br />
          In the Descriptive Catalogue, Blake chastises Stothard’s Plowman for two primary reasons: Stothard’s characterization of him as an old man and his reliance on color over line in the construction of his figure’s form. Blake first lays out the text informing his own depiction of the Plowman from Chaucer, stating:
          <br />
          The Plowman is simplicity itself, with wisdom and strength for its stamina. Chaucer has divided the ancient character of Hercules between his Miller and his Plowman. Benevolence is the plowman’s great characteristic, he is thin with excessive labour, and not with old age, as some have supposed.
          <br />
          ‘He would thresh and thereto dike and delve

          For Christe’s sake, for every poore wight,

          Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.’[1]
          <br />
          True to his description, Blake emphasizes the gauntness of the Plowman’s cheeks as well as the leathery texture of his skin from excessive hours toiling under the sun. He critiques Stothard’s equation of hard work with old age as another departure from Chaucer’s intent in the original text. He writes that Chaucer,
          <br />
          has respected his True Pilgrims, who are a majority of his company, and are not thrown together in the random manner that Mr. S[tothard] has done. Chaucer has no where called the Plowman old, worn out with age and labour, as the prospectus has represented him, and says, that the picture has done so too. He is worn down with labour, not with age.[2]
          <br />
          Blake’s peculiar insistence on this point that the Plowman is worn out with labour and not old age is related to his equally particular emphasis on the relationship he describes earlier in the Descriptive Catalogue between Chaucer’s Plowman and Hercules. Blake elaborates:
          <br />
          The Plowman of Chaucer is Hercules in his supreme eternal state, divested of his spectrous shadow; which is the Miller, a terrible fellow, such as exists in all times and places, for the trial of men, to astonish every neighborhood, with brutal strength and courage, to get rich and powerful to curb the pride of Man.[3]
          <br />
          Several scholars have argued that Blake’s prolonged defense of the Plowman suggests not only elevated respect for this particular pilgrim but also a personal identification with the Plowman. Karl Kiralis first highlighted a physical likeness between the Plowman and Blake’s own portrait (though he does not cite a specific work).[4] Similarly, Warren Stevenson points out that the Plowman’s wide-brimmed hat is somewhat similar to the hat Blake wears in John Linnel’s drawing of him for the frontispiece to Mona Wilson’s Life of William Blake.[5] Lastly, Alexander Gourlay highlights the similar physiognomy between Blake’s Plowman and James Deville’s life mask of Blake from 1823.[6] Gourlay argues that “by portraying himself in this role Blake becomes the genuine hero ignored in these and Chaucer’s times: the starved and neglected Plowman, the man who does the difficult and productive work in the society, contrasts dramatically with the sleek, honored, parasitic drones who dominate the procession and the culture as a whole.” Thus, Blake’s self-association with the Plowman emphasizes their shared marginalization from societies, both past and present, who do not recognize their efforts or genius.

          Although Blake takes issue with Stothard’s loose interpretation of Chaucer’s text throughout his Descriptive Catalogue, he addresses this problem specifically in relation the Monk. In Stothard’s version at right, the Monk rides in front of the Friar, who sits slightly back and to the right. In Blake’s engraving at left, the Monk, whose face is shown in profile, rides behind the Friar, who turns his head back toward his companion. Blake emphasizes Stothard’s literary incompetence when depicting these two pilgrims:
          <br />
          He [Stothard] has done all by chance, or perhaps his fortune, money, money. According to his prospectus he has Three Monks; these he cannot find in Chaucer, who has only One Monk, and that no vulgar character, as he has endeavoured to make him. When men cannot read they should not pretend to paint. To be sure Chaucer is a little difficult to him who has only blundered over novels and catchpenny trifles of booksellers. Yet a little pains ought to be taken even by the ignorant and weak.[1]  
          <br />
          Although Stothard only includes a single Monk in his final composition, Blake still critiques this Monk’s “vulgar” character, a judgment likely resulting from Stothard’s decision to place the Monk and Friar behind the Wife of Bath in the procession. The round-faced, chubby religious figures gaze in her direction and sport somewhat ridiculous smiles that compromise the assumed seriousness of their positions.
          <br />
          In contrast to this perceived baseness of character, Blake outlines his alternative interpretation of the Monk:
          <br />
          For the Monk is described by Chaucer, as a man of the first rank in society, noble, rich, and expensively attended: he is a leader of the age, with certain humourous accompaniments in his character, that do not degrade but render him an object of dignified mirth, but also with other accompaniments not so respectable.[2]
          <br />
          Alexander S. Gourlay highlights the Monk’s resemblance to the standard position of profile heads minted on coins, underscoring the traditional dignity with which the Monk is portrayed. However, to explain in part Blake’s characterization of the Monk as an “object of dignified mirth,” Gourlay also suggests the pilgrim’s specific resemblance to King George III and points to coins of the period and to a particularly striking caricature of George as a tonsured priest as evidence.[3] He points to Blake’s further characterization of the Monk to support his point, in which the artist details the complexities of the pilgrim, stating: “Though a man of luxury, pride and pleasure, he is a master of art and learning, though affecting to despise it. Those who can think that the proud Huntsman, and noble Housekeeper, Chaucer’s Monk, is intended for a buffoon or burlesque character, know little of Chaucer.”[4] Whether Blake intended the Monk to represent the English king, the very possibility of it, coupled with his extended textual description of the pilgrim, emphasizes the extent to which Blake, too, altered or at least added to the original characterization of the pilgrims outlined by Chaucer in The Canterbury Tales.
          <br />
          Blake continues with a lengthy description of the Friar and, quoting Chaucer’s text often, explains the Friar was:
          <br />
          a character also of a mixed kind. ‘A friar there was, a wanton and a merry.’ [B]ut in his office he is said to be a ‘full solemn man:’ eloquent, amorous, witty, and satyrical; young, handsome, and rich; he is a complete rogue; with constitutional gaiety enough to make him a master of all the pleasures of the word. ‘His neck was white as the flour de lis, Thereto strong he was as a champioun.’[5]
          <br />
          And Blake does portray his Friar as handsome, with a thick, columnar neck and fleshy, rosy lips—a stark contrast to the multitude of chins that Stothard includes on his buffoon-like Friar. However, Blake also may gesture toward the Friar’s unstable solemnity through his positioning. Unlike the Monk, who stares intensely forward toward, one would imagine, the religious object of their travel, the Friar turns away from the pilgrims in front of him and shifts his eyes slightly back. He also points to the left with his left hand, visible above the mane of the Monk’s horse. He may gesture toward the Pardonner riding immediately behind the Monk, who also turns to the left, or perhaps to the Host in the center, who may be in the throws of launching his call for the story-telling competition. With any of these situations, the Friar certainly attempts to redirect the Monk’s stoic, fixed gaze back to the realm of baser human activity.

          Arguably the most prominent figure in Blake’s engraving, the Host, Henry Baillie (seen here at left), rides in the middle of the procession at the center of the compositional space. Turning his torso to his right, he extends both arms so that his overall body position assumes a cruciform posture. Although he faces the viewer, his gaze is somewhat vacant and directed slightly left of center. Tight clothing emphasizes his corpulent body, and the objects in his hand—the horse’s reins in his left and a riding crop in his right—draw attention to his long fingers topped with pointed nails. His horse appears diminutive in relation to his heaviness and certainly does not exert the wild energy characteristic of many other animals along the procession.
          <br />
          Despite the Host’s rather uncomely outward appearance, Blake extols the pilgrim’s internal character:
          <br />
          For the Host who follows this group, and holds the center of the cavalcade, is a first rate character, and his jokes are no trifles; they are always, though uttered with audacity, and equally free with the Lord and the Peasant, they are always substantially and weightily expressive of knowledge and experience; Henry Baillie, the keeper of the greatest Inn, of the greatest City; for such was the Tabarde Inn in Southwark, near London: our Host was also a leader of the age.[1]
          <br />
          He compares the Host to Silenus, the satyr in Greek mythology who was a companion of Dionysus and, though wise, was often drunk. The unfocused stare of Blake’s Host may suggest that he, too, like the Cook and the Wife of Bath who hold visible drinking glasses, has indulged in a “morning’s draught of comfort” before beginning the pilgrimage.[2] Nevertheless, the Host in Blake’s composition fulfills his entertaining duties as he unites both halves of the pilgrims through his outspread arms and his likely forthcoming proposition to begin the storytelling game.
          <br />
          Although riding near the front rather than the middle of the procession, Stothard’s Host (seen at right) is also depicted in an attention-drawing gesture, presumably to call for the start of the competition. Whereas Blake’s Host wears an vaguely Elizabethan style ruffed collar and tights, the Host in Stothard’s version wears clothing made of a heavier material that covers nearly his entire body. He rides left but has turned sharply to his left and faces the pilgrims behind him so that his head is visible only in profile. His mouth is clearly open, and he raises his left arm and holds an indistinguishable object in his hand that his displays to those following him. Like the Host in Blake’s composition, his body appears quite heavy and the skin below his chin sags. The Host’s turn rightward constitutes a bracket of sorts to contain the pilgrims behind him and thus excluding the Miller (who appears quite uninterested in the Host’s call for a game anyway) in front of him at left.

          Embodying what Blake calls the “spectrous shadow” of the Plowman, the Miller forms the other baser half of the ideal Herculean state that Blake discusses in his Descriptive Catalogue. Blake characterizes the Miller as an omnipresent, irredeemable figure:
          <br />
          The Plowman of Chaucer is Hercules in his supreme eternal state, divested of his spectrous shadow; which is the Miller, a terrible fellow, such as exists in all times and places, for the trial of men, to astonish every neighborhood, with brutal strength and courage, to get rich and powerful to curb the pride of Man.[1]
          <br />
          In Blake’s composition, the Miller (seen here at left) rides near the rear of the procession between the Wife of Bath and the Cook. He is shown with short, curly hair and a full beard that extends out from his face in flame-like tufts in all directions. He stares in the direction of the Wife of Bath with large, widely open eyes set above a broad, flat nose. He holds a musical instrument to his lips with his right hand, and the attached horn or pipe extends over his left shoulder and behind his head. His complexion is darker than most of the other pilgrims’ skin, perhaps to accentuate Blake’s characterization of him as a “shadow.”
          <br />
          Stothard’s Miller (seen at right) also prominently plays an instrument—here more clearly a bagpipe. In Stothard’s composition, the Miller leads the procession as the leftmost rider. His posture and appearance, however, contrast with his ostensible place of prominence. Slumped forward with heavily lidded eyes, the Miller plods forward, making no motion to turn in the direction of the Host who appears to speak behind him. Whereas most of the other pilgrims in Stothard’s composition animatedly interact with one another, the Miller stares ahead in profile, and the parenthesis-like curvature of the Host’s body behind him further emphasizes his separation from the rest of the pilgrims.
