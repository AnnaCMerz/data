    <image dbi="Reeve Chaucer Clerk of Oxenford Cook 1-4" id="10">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Reeve">
          The Reeve appears at the far left of procession. His appearance makes him the most devious-looking in the group: his short hair is matted atop his prominent brow, he has a large hooked nose, his cheek is gaunt, and his lips are turned slightly upward in an ambiguous smile. His garment is vertically striped with a prominent collar or hood. He is framed by a Gothic-styled portal. The Reeve is smaller than the other pilgrims, thus furthest removed from the viewer. This also exaggerates the heft of Chaucer, riding in front of and to the right of the Reeve.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Chaucer">
          Chaucer is second from the left. Although shown in full profile, his head is turned slightly right, toward the viewer. His head covering identifies him as Chaucer: it is worn in nearly all portraits of him. However, this covering is white instead of the usual black. He appears to be engrossed in something other than the scene in front of him: his large eyes are open although his gaze is vacant and unfixed, and his lips are closed and slightly downturned. Details suggest his prominence: the collar, bottom hem, and sleeve cuffs of his gown are elaborately decorated and his physical heft denotes strength. He also carries religious ornaments, such as the string of ten prayer beads in his bare right hand, and travel necessities, such as the mat or blanket rolled up behind his back. The hem of the gown is wrinkled or swishing, suggesting movement forward. Chaucer sits on a dark horse that holds its downturned face and front left leg at a right angle and directs its gaze toward the Clerk’s horse.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Clerk of Oxenford">
          The Clerk of Oxenford appears third from the left. His long hair flows from beneath a dark, square cap. Like Chaucer, his wide, open eyes gaze forward, although his attention appears more fixed. His thin, straight eyebrows and tightly closed lips additionally suggest concentration. His gown mirrors the texture and color of Chaucer’s, although its decoration is more geometrical. He sits very erect on a light-colored horse. The horse appears haggard but its legs mirror those of Chaucer’s horse.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Cook">
          The cook appears fourth from the left, although only his upper torso, head, and raised hands are visible. His face is in profile and tilted back to drink what is presumably beer; he raises the tankard with his left hand and supports its weight with his right. His white cap, tied with a dark ribbon, covers any possible hair. A tall collar and ruffled sleeves decorate his garment. The cook’s appearance is more caricature than portraiture: his protruding brow, heavy-lidded eyes, snub nose, flaring nostril, and thick, pouting lips emphasize inebriation. 
      </caption>

    <image dbi="Miller Wife of Bath Merchant 5-7" id="11">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Miller">
          The miller is fifth from the left and one of the few African pilgrims. He turns slightly right but faces the viewer with large, open eyes. He has dark skin; dark, thick, tightly coiled hair; and a thick beard and mustache that flare outward. His thick, arched eyebrows and wide nose are prominent facial features. He holds the mouthpiece of a bagpipe with his large right hand; the bass drone extends over his left shoulder. He wears a simple long-sleeved tunic with a tall collar or hood clasped at the neck with a single button. 
      </caption>

      <caption title="Wife of Bath">
          Sixth from the left, the Wife of Bath rides sidesaddle and her whole body faces the viewer. Her sexuality is emphasized through slightly spread knees and breasts, with visible nipples, that swell out of her dress. Her posture and expression suggest relaxed ease: she looks upward and to the right with an open-mouthed smile and leans back in the saddle. She holds her horse’s reins and riding crop (with a decorative top shaped like a cock’s head) in one hand and a glass presumably filled with wine in the other. Her dress showcases her wealth: several adornments cover her head including a knitted bonnet and three elaborate collars that create a halo effect. The cone-shaped hat atop the second collar mimics the flourishes of the large, spiky collar extending outward from her shoulders. She wears long earrings and three strands of pearls around her neck and bare chest; the middle strand holds a cross and the bottom strand holds a large heart. Her white dress clings to her torso and waist and her lap is covered by a patterned blanket. She wears stockings and white elbow-length gloves. Her horse’s reins and mane are decorated with small bows and bells. Blake's presentation of the Wife of Bath resembles his later depiction of the Whore of Babylon, a water color version of which is dated c. 1809 (Butlin 523). Similarities can be seen in the position, necklace with the heart, and chalice in the right hand of both figures.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Merchant">
          Seventh from the left, the merchant observes the Wife of Bath. He appears exhausted: his long, gaunt face mirrors the taper of his thin, hooked nose and his eyes are nearly half closed. However, his raised eyebrows suggest surprise or alarm. His dark beard extends into two pointed tufts. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, an overcoat with a stiff, possibly braided collar, and a minimally embellished undershirt. Part of his horse’s face appears to the right of the parson.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Parson Man of Law and Plowman 8-10" id="12">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Parson">
          Eighth from the left, the Parson concentrates on the progress of the pilgrimage. He is in full profile facing right and stares directly ahead with open eyes and closed lips as he rides forward. His long, white hair and beard and his lined brow suggest age. He wears dark clothing including a circular hat with a small brim; a long, unadorned gown with upturned hems; and shoes with white laces. Simple bridling adorns his fairly shaggy, short-tailed horse, which slightly raises its back left and front right hoof, showing metal shoes. Its eyes are heavily lidded.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Man of Law">
          Ninth from the left, the Man of Law partially faces the viewer. His large, open eyes stare forward toward a distant scene. He has a shaggy, coarse white-gray beard and mustache and his hair peaks beneath a triangular, narrow-brimmed, tasseled hat. He wears possibly three layers of clothes, including an overcoat with split sleeves, a woven shirt, and a short lace collar. Aside from a bit of his right knee and leg, his lower body is mostly obscured by the Parson’s horse. His dark horse’s eyes are large, bright, and open and its ears are perked; its bit and reins are simple.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Plowman">
          The Plowman rides tenth from the left. Like the Parson, he stares ahead in full profile facing right. The Plowman has been compared by critics to Blake himself, a plowman in copper. The Plowman’s light-colored, woven hat has a wide, loose brim similar in style to the one worn by the traveler in plate 16 of For Children: the Gates of Paradise (1793). The Plowman’s shoulder-length hair falls out of his hat, his tan skin, angular face, and vein protruding on his neck all indicate outdoor labor. His haggard horse contrasts with the attentiveness of the Plowman and adjacent horses.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Image4" id="13">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Physician">
          The Physician rides eleventh from the left, leftmost among four closely grouped pilgrims. His wide-open eyes and raised eyebrows express surprise as he faces forward in a three-quarter view. His elaborate hat is composed of a dark circular upper portion; a white fur brim; and two long ear flaps that mirror the long, columnar structure of his face and nose. His overcoat has a white fur trim and his undershirt has a geometric pattern. Although shaggy, his horse’s decorated rein matches the opulence of the Physician’s attire. It looks toward the Plowman’s horse.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Franklin">
          The Franklin rides twelfth from the left, second among the four closely grouped pilgrims. Unlike most of the other pilgrims, he gazes up. His horse and much of his body are obscured by the Physician but his wealth as a landowner is apparent: his voluminous white hair extends into an ample, well-trimmed beard; he wears a cap decorated with a large jewel and two white feathers; and his garment is decorated with an intricate pattern. His gloved hand holds the reins closely to his chest.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Two Citizens">
          Riding in the background, the thirteenth and fourteenth riders form a pair among the group of four pilgrims. Only their heads and upper torsos are visible. Both wear identical hats with rounded tops and upturned brims and, although more of the right citizen’s clothes are visible, both appear to wear a similar high-collared coat. However, their expressions differ: the leftmost citizen looks forward with raised brows and slightly parted lips while the rightmost citizen stares toward the viewer with slightly furrowed brows and pursed lips.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Shipman">
          Fifteenth from the left, the Shipman is the only figure to twist his body to look behind him. His gaze appears to meet that of the Plowman; together, they frame the group of four pilgrims. His left hand rests on his horse’s rump to support his body while the other extends, perhaps to hold reins. He has a dark, deeply tanned complexion; a long, dark beard; and dark, heavy brows that accentuate his scowl. He wears a round, fur-trimmed cap and a simple, woven garment.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Image5" id="14">

      <title>The Host</title>

      <caption>
          Sixteenth from the left, the Host commands attention for his central placement, hefty size, and grandiose gesture. He leans back against a rolled blanket (similar to Chaucer’s), turns his torso to face the viewer, and extends his arms perpendicularly in a cruciform posture. His oval-shaped face, double-chin, and form-fitting garment accentuate his portly physique. Like the Franklin, he wears a round hat with a central jewel and two feathers. Curly, light-colored hair is visible beneath. His raised brows and pursed lips ambiguously express either pleasure or concern as he gazes over his right shoulder. A wide ruffled collar, four clasps, and a belt holding a sword or dagger adorn his garment. He wears riding boots and holds a riding crop in his right hand and reins in the left. His dark, graceful horse lifts only its rear left hoof off the ground.
      </caption>

    <image dbi="Image6" id="15">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Summoner">
          Seventeenth from the left, the Summoner turns in a three-quarter view to face the Pardoner. He has a dark complexion; heavy, dark brows turned upward; and a smile that accentuates his rounded face. A floral wreath or garland covers his head and a similar garland (or fur trim) is draped over his garment. His right arm bends at the elbow to reach toward the Pardoner; the fingers disappear behind the Pardoner’s waist in a sexually suggestive position. The shaft of a musical instrument extends from his right hand towards his right shoulder, where a mouthpiece is visible. Only the rump of his horse is visible. The Summoner may be a caricature of the Whig politician Charles James Fox (1749-1806).
      </caption>

      <caption title="Manciple">
          Riding in the background and only visible above the shoulders, the Manciple appears eighteenth from the left. His neck is turned sharply to look over his right shoulder and his gaze turns slightly upward. Downturned brows and tightly set lips suggest inquisitiveness. A circular feathered cap covers white hair that extends into a beard and mustache; the hair obscures his left ear. A lace collar shows beneath his garment.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Pardoner">
          Nineteenth from the left, the Pardoner twists his torso to the left to look behind him. Highly feminized details characterize his face, rendered in profile. He has long, light-colored hair that falls down his back; no facial hair; a small, triangular nose; a high forehead; and a receding chin. A long hood trails from his cap. His gown fits loosely, except for the sleeves. In addition to the cross on the back of his gown, on his bag, and on his horse’s bridle, he holds a large jeweled cross in his right hand. He places his left hand on his horse’s rump for support. The horse twists its head to the right, an opposite movement from that of its rider. The Pardoner’s horse is the only one to be shown with all four hooves on the ground, completely stopped. The Pardoner may be a caricature of William Pit the Younger (1759-1806), Tory politician and Prime Minister.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Monk">
          Twentieth from the right, the monk is seen in profile as he stares directly ahead and slightly upward. His head is large and round and his chin recedes into prominent jowls. White, curly hair circles his head, which is either nearly bald or tonsured. Like the Friar he wears a dark habit with a stiff circular hood; the rest of his body is obscured by the Pardoner’s horse. His left hand holds his horse’s reins tightly to his chest. Only his horse’s mane, decorated with bells, is visible.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Friar">
          The Friar, tenth from the right, turns toward the Monk on his right. Only his shoulders and head are visible. Like the Monk, he is bald or tonsured; his face is round and his chin recedes into his neck; and he wears a dark habit with a stiff circular hood. Unlike the Monk, he has a slight smile. He points with his left index finger toward the Monk or Pardoner.
      </caption>

      <caption title="A Citizen">
          Ninth from the right, a male citizen is shown in direct right profile. He resembles the two citizens riding behind him: he wears a hat with an upturned brim and a garment with tall lapels, and his shaggy hair extends into a beard and mustache. His brow is knitted, perhaps in contemplation of the journey ahead. His horse is not visible.
      </caption>

      <title></title>

      <caption title="Lady Abbess">
          The Lady Abbess is prominently featured in the foreground eighth from the right. She gazes slightly to the right with tightly closed lips. Her serene expression, delicate features, and elegant posture contrast with the female rider behind her, the Wife of Bath. Her light, long hair falls loosely down her back and she wears a crown with the sign of the cross that supports a long black veil. The white upper portion of her garment cinches at her upper arms and below her bosom, and a dark habit covers the rest of her body. Rosary beads decorated with ribbon and a medallion with the words “Amor Vincit Omnia” hang from her right wrist. She holds a riding crop in her right hand. Her horse is elaborately decorated: aside from the net covering draped over its body, the reins and bridle top are attractively detailed. Her horse’s elegant stride and gaze echo the composure of its rider. Two greyhounds play underneath: one strides forward in a gait that mirrors the horse’s while the other jumps up to paw at the horse. Present in Chaucer’s original texts, these dogs also link the Lady Abbess with the mythological Diana, as noted by Warren Stevenson.[1]

      </caption>

      <caption title="Nun">
          The nun rides seventh from the right and turns her head directly toward the viewer. Older than her female companion, she has a round face, thick curly hair, and downturned eyes with heavy lids. A white wimple completely covers her neck and is also visible near the crown of her head. She wears a light-colored garment and, like the Lady Abbess, a black veil; it covers her shoulders and clasps over her chest. Her gloved right hand gestures toward the three priests to her left. Her horse’s head appears directly to the right of the Lady Abbess’ horse. Like its rider, it turns its head to look toward the viewer.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Three Priests">
          The group of three priests ride fourth, fifth, and sixth from the right. The leftmost of the group is shown in a three-quarter view and gazes upward with an entranced or contemplative expression. The raised circular hood of his habit emphasizes his round head. He has short, curly hair and a youthful appearance. The middle priest appears sterner: his face is gaunt and his dark hair, sizable beard, severe brows and tightly set lips create a stoic expression. He may be looking toward the Squire’s Yeoman. The rightmost in the group appears oldest and most dejected. Shown in right profile, his heavily lidded eyes, hooked nose, and downturned mouth emphasize the downward sag of his appearance. He has a white, bushy beard. The leftmost and rightmost priests have lightly colored, woven habits while the center priest has a dark habit with a light, braided edge.
      </caption>

      <title>Squire's Yeoman</title>

      <caption>
          The Squire’s Yeoman rides third from the right. His head is tilted back and turned sharply to the right to look at the viewer. He has a tan complexion and thick, curly hair. His large eyes, drooping lids, beard stubble, and sagging chin give him a tired appearance. His raised hood is attached to a garment that has a large brooch or gem in the front. His right hand, elaborately gloved with, perhaps, chainmail, holds a long, curved bow.
      </caption>

    </image>

    <image dbi="Image9" id="18">

      <title></title>

      <caption title="The Knight">
          The Knight rides in the foreground second from the right. He twists his torso so his chest faces the viewer; his head is turned further to the right and shown in a three-quarter view. Although his face is covered with chainmail, his gray hair and beard are visible. He appears knowing and self-confident: he sits straight, his brows are slightly arched, and his lips are pressed together in a slight smile. The chainmail encircling his head and neck connects to a breastplate; below the breastplate, more chainmail extends over his hips and down his arms, and plated armor covers his right leg. Fabric is draped around his shoulders. Two more sashes cross his body: one across his chest supports a cross and another extends diagonally across his torso. The image of a horse and rider below the cross may be an additional emblem or it may be the hilt of his sword. His left hand holds his horse’s reins and his right hand gestures to the left with an open palm. His horse is minimally adorned except for the large jewel on its bridle and the netted covering over its haunches. Left of the horse a fierce, mangy black dog treads forward and stares directly ahead.
      </caption>

      <caption title="Squire">
          The Squire, first on the right side of the composition, leads the party. He sits taller than his companions and gazes slightly right of the viewer, perhaps surveying the path ahead. He wears a hat with two voluminous feathers over his tightly curled hair. He has a slight smile and a thin mustache above his lips. Stevenson describes his youthful appearance as “Apollonian.”[1] A decorated overcoat clasps at his neck and a lace collar shows underneath. Although the rider appears stoic, his horse is the most active of the procession: both of its front legs are raised off the ground in a forward gallop and its head is turned to face the viewer directly. Its front legs appear furthest to the right of the composition and demarcate the beginning of the procession.

      <title>The Wife of Bath</title>

      <caption>
Blake and Stothard create starkly different portrayals of the Wife of Bath. Blake’s version is informed by what he perceives as a binary relationship between the Wife of Bath and the Lady Prioress, representatives of the two classes of women. He asserts: 
	      
<blockquote>
Are not these leaders of the ages of men? The lady prioress, in some ages, predominates; and in some the Wife of Bath, in whose character Chaucer has been equally minute and exact; because she is also a scourge and a blight. I shall say no more of her, nor expose what Chaucer has left hidden; let the young reader study what he has said of her: it is useful as a scare-crow. There are of such characters born too many for the peace of the world.[1]
</blockquote>
 
Blake’s Wife of Bath signifies loose sexuality, false piety, and preoccupation with worldly materials and power, characterized by the cross necklace suspended between exposed breasts; the star-shaped spur above her right heel; the cock-headed riding crop in one hand and wine in the other; prominently spread legs facing the viewer; and an appearance compromised by buck teeth, a sagging chin, and a hooked nose.
<br />
 
In contrast, Stothard’s Wife of Bath wears plain, modest clothing and a wimple and hat covering her hair, head, and chin. The wimple is included in Chaucer’s original description but is notably disregarded by Blake. Stothard’s Wife of Bath is portrayed as attractive, young, and comely, as she looks playfully over her left shoulder toward the pilgrims behind her. Blake lambasts the design in his <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, deriding both Stothard and his reviewer John Hoppner:

<blockquote>
In this manner he has jumbled his dumb dollies together, and is praised by his equals for it; for both himself and his friend are equally masters of Chaucer’s language. They both think that the Wife of Bath is a young beautiful blooming damsel; and H[oppner] says, that she is the Fair Wife of Bath, and that the Spring appears in her Cheeks. Now hear what Chaucer has made her say of herself, who is no modest one,
<br /><br />
‘But Lord when it rememberth me
<br />
Upon my youth and on my jollity,
<br />
It tickleth me about the heart root.
<br />
Unto this day it doth my heart boot,
<br />
That I have had my world as in my time;
<br />
But age, alas, that all will envenime,
<br />
Hath me bereft, my beauty and my pith
<br />
Let go; farewell: the devel go therewith,
<br />
The flower is gone, there is no more to tell.
<br />
The bran, as best, I can, I now mote sell;
<br />
And yet, to be right merry, will I fond,
<br />
Now forth to tell of my fourth husband.’[2]
</blockquote>
 
Stothard portrays the Wife of Bath with no external markers of her flawed internal character instead of as a “scare-crow” for the edification of viewers, as Blake does. Blake hails that situating her in a “common scene” like Hoppner describes is the most dangerous disguise for such a woman.

      <title>The Knight and Squire</title>

      <caption>
          Blake begins the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> with descriptions of the Knight and the Squire, the two rightmost figures in his composition. He argues that his placement echoes Chaucer’s, who “has also placed them first in his prologue.”[1] Blake then launches into a laudatory account of the pair’s characters:
          <blockquote>
          The Knight is a true Hero, a good, great, and wise man; his whole length portrait on horseback, as written by Chaucer, cannot be surpassed. He has spent his life in the field; has ever been a conqueror, and is that species of character which in every age stands as the guardian of man against the oppressor. His son [the Squire] is like him with the germ of perhaps greater perfection still, as he blends literature and the arts with his warlike studies. Their dress and their horses are of the first rate, without ostentation, and with all the true grandeur that unaffected simplicity when in high rank always displays.[2]
          </blockquote>
	  The full-length portrait of the mounted knight accords with Chaucer’s text: he wears the armor and accouterments expected of a life of conquest on the battlefield. His posture and gesture also suggest leadership.
	      <br />
	  This depiction contrasts with Stothard’s Knight at right, the second visible pilgrim from the left. 
Stothard’s Knight is shown in profile crowded among the other pilgrims and wears stylish civilian attire, including a large black hat. Stothard places the Knight and the Squire seventh and ninth, respectively, in the procession, with the Reeve between them. Blake highlights this placement as an erroneous departure from Chaucer’s text, asserting, “nothing need be done but to examine my rival’s prospectus. The two first characters in Chaucer, the Knight and the Squire, he has put among his rabble; and indeed his prospectus calls the Squire the fop of Chaucer’s age.”[3] Blake then quotes three sections of Chaucer’s introduction in which he lists various honorable qualities of the Squire and asks rhetorically after each: “Was this a fop?” [4]
          <br />
        Blake observes that “Chaucer makes every one of his characters perfect in his kind, every one is an Antique Statue; the image of a class, and not of an imperfect individual.” [5] This particularity of Blake’s approach is evident in his statuesque depiction of the Squire, whom he associates with Apollo. Stothard’s Squire, in contrast, leans back as his horse lurches wildly beneath him.

      <title>The Plowman</title>

      <caption>
      Both Blake and Stothard distance the Plowman from the viewer, obscuring all but the pilgrim’s head and shoulders. Both depictions are in profile and both are similarly attired in a wide-brimmed hat and simple shirt. Stothard’s Plowman also wears a protective neck covering. Blake’s depiction, however, is more intricately detailed, exemplified by the visible veins on the Plowman’s neck.
          <br />
In his <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, Blake chastises Stothard for depicting his Plowman as aged and for a reliance on color over line. Blake first compares his depiction to Chaucer’s text:
          <blockquote>
          The Plowman is simplicity itself, with wisdom and strength for its stamina. Chaucer has divided the ancient character of Hercules between his Miller and his Plowman. Benevolence is the plowman’s great characteristic, he is thin with excessive labour, and not with old age, as some have supposed.
          <br /><br />
          ‘He would thresh and thereto dike and delve
          <br />
          For Christe’s sake, for every poore wight,
	  <br />
          Withouten hire, if it lay in his might.’[1]
          </blockquote>
        True to the text, the gaunt cheeks and leathery skin of Blake’s Plowman are associated with outdoor labor. He criticizes Stothard for departing from the text by associating hard work with old age. He writes that Chaucer, 
          <blockquote>
          has respected his True Pilgrims, who are a majority of his company, and are not thrown together in the random manner that Mr. S[tothard] has done. Chaucer has no where called the Plowman old, worn out with age and labour, as the prospectus has represented him, and says, that the picture has done so too. He is worn down with labour, not with age.[2]
          </blockquote>
         Earlier in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, Blake relates Chaucer’s Plowman to Hercules. Blake elaborates:
         <blockquote>
          The Plowman of Chaucer is Hercules in his supreme eternal state, divested of his spectrous shadow; which is the Miller, a terrible fellow, such as exists in all times and places, for the trial of men, to astonish every neighborhood, with brutal strength and courage, to get rich and powerful to curb the pride of Man.[3]
          </blockquote>
          Several scholars have argued that Blake’s prolonged defense of the Plowman suggests not only elevated respect, but also a personal identification. Karl Kiralis first highlighted a physical likeness between the Plowman and Blake – though he does not cite a specific portrait[4]. Warren Stevenson points out that the Plowman’s wide-brimmed hat is somewhat similar to the hat Blake wears in John Linnell’s drawing of him [5]. Lastly, Alexander Gourlay highlights the similar physiognomy of Blake’s Plowman and James Deville’s life mask of Blake from 1823[6]. Gourlay argues that “by portraying himself in this role Blake becomes the genuine hero ignored in these and Chaucer’s times: the starved and neglected Plowman, the man who does the difficult and productive work in the society, contrasts dramatically with the sleek, honored, parasitic drones who dominate the procession and the culture as a whole.” Blake’s self-association with the Plowman emphasizes their shared marginalization in past and present societies that failed to recognize their efforts or genius.

      <title>The Monk and Friar</title>

      <caption>
Blake takes particular issue with Stothard’s loose interpretation of Chaucer’s text in relation to the Monk. In Stothard’s version at right, the Monk rides slightly in front of and to the left of the Friar, whereas in Blake’s version the Friar rides in front, turning his head back toward his companion. Blake targets Stothard’s literary incompetence to account for the difference:
          <blockquote>
          He [Stothard] has done all by chance, or perhaps his fortune, money, money. According to his prospectus he has Three Monks; these he cannot find in Chaucer, who has only One Monk, and that no vulgar character, as he has endeavoured to make him. When men cannot read they should not pretend to paint. To be sure Chaucer is a little difficult to him who has only blundered over novels and catchpenny trifles of booksellers. Yet a little pains ought to be taken even by the ignorant and weak.[1]  
          </blockquote>
Stothard includes a single Monk in his final composition, but Blake critiques this Monk’s “vulgar” character, suggested by his placement behind the Wife of Bath. Their exaggeratedly round faces and somewhat ridiculous smiles compromise the assumed seriousness of their positions.
          <br />
Blake outlines his alternative interpretation of the Monk:
	      <br />
          For the Monk is described by Chaucer, as a man of the first rank in society, noble, rich, and expensively attended: he is a leader of the age, with certain humourous accompaniments in his character, that do not degrade but render him an object of dignified mirth, but also with other accompaniments not so respectable.[2]
          <br />
Alexander S. Gourlay notes that Blake’s Monk resembles profile heads minted on coins, underscoring traditional dignity. Specifically, Gourley notes a resemblance to King George III in coins of the period and to a particularly striking caricature of George as a tonsured priest. He supports this comparison through Blake’s characterization of the Monk’s complexities. Blake states, “Though a man of luxury, pride and pleasure, he is a master of art and learning, though affecting to despise it. Those who can think that the proud Huntsman, and noble Housekeeper, Chaucer’s Monk, is intended for a buffoon or burlesque character, know little of Chaucer”[4]. Whether Blake intended the Monk to resemble the English king, the possibility of it, coupled with his extended description of the pilgrim, emphasize the extent to which Blake, too, altered or added to Chaucer’s original characterization. 
          <br />
Blake continues with a lengthy description of the Friar, integrating Chaucer’s text to explain that he was
	      <blockquote>
          a character also of a mixed kind. ‘A friar there was, a wanton and a merry.’ [B]ut in his office he is said to be a ‘full solemn man:’ eloquent, amorous, witty, and satyrical; young, handsome, and rich; he is a complete rogue; with constitutional gaiety enough to make him a master of all the pleasures of the word. ‘His neck was white as the flour de lis, Thereto strong he was as a champioun.’[5]
         </blockquote>
The thick yet graceful columnar neck and rosy lips of Blake’s Friar contrasts with the multitude of chins on Stothard’s buffoonish Friar. However, the movements of Blake’s Friar might also suggest the pilgrim’s unstable solemnity. Unlike the Monk, who stares forward toward, most likely, the religious object of their travel, the Friar shifts his gaze slightly back and points to the left, toward either the Pardoner or the Host. He attempts to redirect the Monk’s stoic gaze back to the realm of baser human activity.

      <title>The Host</title>

      <caption>
The Host, Henry Baillie, is depicted prominently in both Blake and Stothard’s engravings. Blake centers the Host within the procession and compositional space. His body assumes a cruciform position as he twists his torso and extends his arms. Despite the Host’s rather uncomely, corpulent appearance, Blake extols the pilgrim’s internal character:
<blockquote>
          For the Host who follows this group, and holds the center of the cavalcade, is a first rate character, and his jokes are no trifles; they are always, though uttered with audacity, and equally free with the Lord and the Peasant, they are always substantially and weightily expressive of knowledge and experience; Henry Baillie, the keeper of the greatest Inn, of the greatest City; for such was the Tabarde Inn in Southwark, near London: our Host was also a leader of the age.[1]
          </blockquote>
          He compares the Host to Silenus, the satyr in Greek mythology who was a companion of Dionysus and, though wise, was often drunk. The unfocused stare of Blake’s Host may suggest that he, like the Cook and the Wife of Bath who hold visible drinking glasses, has indulged in a “morning’s draught of comfort” before beginning the pilgrimage [2]. Nevertheless, the Host in Blake’s composition fulfills his entertaining duties: he unites both halves of the pilgrims through his outspread arms and his likely forthcoming proposition to begin the storytelling game.
          <br />
Stothard’s Host, at right, rides near the front rather than middle of the procession. He also gestures to draw attention, presumably to call for the start of the competition. Unlike the ornate ruffed collar and tights worn by Blake’s Host, Stothard’s Host wears heavier, simpler clothing that fully covers his body – although like Blake’s Host, he appears quite heavy. He turns sharply to face the pilgrims behind him, his mouth open while displaying an indistinguishable object in his raised left hand. The Host’s turned horse and body act as a sort of bracket to contain the pilgrims, although excluding the Miller, who appears quite uninterested in the Host’s call for a game.

      <title>The Miller</title>

      <caption>
The Miller embodies what Blake calls the “spectrous shadow” of the Plowman, forming the baser half of the ideal Herculean state that Blake discusses in his <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>. Blake characterizes the Miller as an omnipresent, irredeemable figure:
         <blockquote>
          The Plowman of Chaucer is Hercules in his supreme eternal state, divested of his spectrous shadow; which is the Miller, a terrible fellow, such as exists in all times and places, for the trial of men, to astonish every neighborhood, with brutal strength and courage, to get rich and powerful to curb the pride of Man.[1]
          </blockquote>
Blake’s Miller rides near the rear of the procession between the Wife of Bath and the Cook. Characterized through thick, curly hair and a flame-like beard, his large eyes stare toward the Wife of Bath while he holds a musical instrument to his lips. His complexion may be darker than the other pilgrims to accentuate Blake’s characterization of him as a “shadow.”
          <br />
In Stothard’s depiction at right the Miller’s instrument is more clearly shown to be a bagpipe. Stothard places the Miller at the front of the procession, but his posture and appearance contrast with his ostensible place of prominence. Slumped forward with heavily lidded eyes, the Miller plods forward and pays no attention to the Host, who appears to speak behind him. Unlike Stothard’s other pilgrims, his Miller does not interact with others. He stares ahead. The Host’s turned body further accentuates the Miller’s separation.

            works. It is the characters which are described in <i>the general Prologue</i> to them which Mr.
            Stothard has now transferred to the Canvas; and with so much truth and sprightliness, and in a
            manner so agreeable, that the Poet’s humor may, with truth, be said to be revived in the Painter.
            It is the particular merit of this piece, that the story is immediately brought home to the
            Spectator. He becomes instantly one of the group, and sees them move before him, marked by
            their distinctive habits, characters, and sensations, in the same manner as Chaucer has drawn
            them. The idea of the Poet is impressed at the first view,—a humor unforced, agreeable, and
            comic; <i>a pleasurable Tour; sanctified by the name of Pilgrimage</i>. The covert ridicule on these
            eccentric excursions, which Chaucer intended, is very happily preserved in his face; the quiet
            indifference of one of the Monks, the hypocrisy of another, and the real piety of a third, are with
            equal excellency portrayed. The gay levity of the Wife of <i>Bath</i>, and the countenance of the old
            Ploughman, worn down with age and labour, are finely rendered. The Miller is an admirable
            character; and his Horse is as much in character as himself. The <i>Fop of Chaucer’s Age</i> is
            exhibited as making a display of his riding; and the Sea Captain bestrides his Nag with the usual
            awkwardness of the Sailor. The pale and studious countenance of the Oxford Scholar; the
            stateliness of the Lady-Abbess; the facetiousness and homely humour of the Host, as contrasted
            with the Segeant at Law, and the Doctor of Physic;—all these peculiarities of character are very
            finely and delicately expressed. The costume of each Person is correct with an antiquarian
            exactness; and the whole Group is so well distributed, that each character is sufficiently seen,
            and in his due place” (39-40).</caption>

            most harmoniously distributed throughout the picture.” The painting “is wholly free from that
            vice which painters term manner” and “bears no mark of the period in which it was painted, but
            might very well pass for the work of some able artist of the time of Chaucer.” It has “a primitive
            simplicity and the total absence of all affectation, either of colour or penciling” (Carey 13).</caption>

            print of the Canterbury pilgrims by William Blake, the mad artist, whose biography may be read
            in Mr. Allan Cunningham’s Lives? He painted it, he says, before Mr. Stothard’s picture on the
            same subject, and nearly thirty years ago he exhibited it publicly, in opposition to that elegant
            composition. Mr. Stothard’s picture is Chaucer modernized—the horses are all barbs, from the
            Elgin Marbles, and the riders, refined and softened, in stage-dresses. Mr. Blake’s picture is
            Chaucer in the old rough verse—“in his habit as he lived”—bad in drawing, but true and vivid in
            expression. His horses are wooden toys, and his dogs pigs; but the individual character is in
            every human face, and look and dress. Mr. Blake understood Chaucer, like Mr. Wordsworth,
            profoundly. Mr. Stothard read him like Mr. Horne, superficially. Together with his Exhibition,
            Mr. Blake gave you, for yr. shilling, a printed description of his Pictures, in contrast with Mr.
            Stothards’. This contained a little madness about painting, and a great deal of abuse of Mr.
