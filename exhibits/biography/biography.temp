Evidence has recently emerged that she and her first husband, a hosier named Thomas Armitage, were members of the Moravian Church (Davies and Schuchard), and some readers have detected echoes of Moravian hymns in Blake’s poems. After Armitage died, Catherine left the Moravians and married James Blake, also a hosier. The Blakes kept a shop at <address><addrline>28 Broad Street</addrline></address> and were in their mid-thirties when

		<name type="person" reg="Blake, Catherine">Catherine </name><date value="1764-1841">(1764-1841)</date>, also figured prominently in

		</p><p>As a child,

		  in the light of what 
		  <name type="person" reg="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth, </name>in his
		  
		<title level="a">Ode: Intimations of Immortality</title>, would later
		call a “visionary gleam.” When he was about nine, he told his

		walks; he later reported a similar vision of “angelic figures
		walking” in a field among workers as they gathered in the hay 
		<bibl>(Gilchrist 1: 7)</bibl>. Unlike the child in 
		<name type="person" reg="Wordsworth, William">Wordsworth’s </name>
		poem, however, 
		<name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake </name> never outgrew
		these visions. He was past fifty when he described seeing the rising sun as
		“an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the
		Lord God Almighty” 
		<bibl>(Erdman 566)</bibl>.</p><p><name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake’s </name> artistic

		  drawing school, where he learned to sketch the human figure by copying from
		  plaster casts of ancient statues. His father encouraged his interest and even
		  bought him some casts of his own. The influence of his early exposure to Greek
		  and Roman sculpture can be seen in 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake’s </name> later
		  work. The Farnese Hercules, for example, is the model for the figure of Giant
		  Despair in

		  <name type="person" reg="Basire, James">Basire’s </name> usual

		  <name type="person" reg="West, Benjamin">Benjamin West’s </name><title level="m">Pylades and Orestes</title>, these were the exception

		of copy engraving as it was practiced in 
		<name type="place">England </name> at the end of the 
		<date certainty="approx">eighteenth century</date>. The standard method
		of preparing a copperplate for etching or engraving was time-consuming and
		labor-intensive. The original large sheet of copper had to be cut into
		appropriate sizes and the edges beveled to facilitate cleaning the ink off the
		plate and to prevent it from tearing the paper. The plate also had to be
		squared and its corners rounded, because the pressure of the printing press
		would leave an impression of the plate’s edges in the paper. Next, the
		surface had to be polished, cleaned, and covered with an acid-resistant film,
		or “ground,” which was then darkened with soot to contrast with the
		copper. Onto this ground the design was then transferred and traced with a
		needle to expose the plate’s surface to acid, which bit the design into
		the copper 
		<bibl>(Viscomi, 
		  <title level="m">Blake </title> 48-50)</bibl>. In a shop like 
		<name type="person" reg="Basire, James">Basire’s </name>, most of

		<name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake. </name></p><p>It is difficult to know which of the works produced in 
		  <name type="person" reg="Basire, James">Basire’s </name> shop
		  during this period 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake</name> himself may have
		  engraved, because engravers’ apprentices were discouraged from developing
		  their own individual styles, and their work was usually signed by the master.

		  <date>1789-1792</date></head><p>At the same time that he was working on these commercial projects, 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake</name> was searching for
		  a better way to print and publish his own work. About 
		  <date value="1788" certainty="approx">1788</date>, he invented relief
		  etching, a process that was both more efficient and potentially more expressive
		  and autographic than traditional intaglio etching. In intaglio graphics, the
		  design must be transferred to the metal plate: either scratched lightly onto
		  the waxed surface and then deepened with an engraving tool, such as a burin, or
		  traced with a needle into an acid-resistant coating, the exposed pattern of
		  lines and dots then being bitten into the plate with acid. Blake’s
		  contemporaries usually tried to optimize quality and efficiency by combining
		  these techniques in “mixed-method” engraving. In relief etching, on
		  the other hand, the design is painted directly onto the copperplate using an
		  acid-resistant varnish. When acid is applied to the plate, the unpainted
		  surface, rather than the design itself, is eaten away, while the design is left
		  standing in relief to be inked and printed. Because the design is above rather
		  than below the surface of the plate, a relief etching also requires less
		  pressure to print than a conventional intaglio etching or engraving. The
		  printed version of a relief etching is, of course, a mirror image of the
		  original design; this means that any text to be included must be written
		  backwards. As a trained copy engraver, however, 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake</name> had already had
		  an opportunity to practice this skill.</p><p>It was 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake’s </name> late
		  brother

		  directed

		  discovery. 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, Robert">Robert</name> had died in

		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake, </name>who had remained

		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, Robert">Robert</name> appeared to him
		  in such a vision and instructed him in a new method of printing his works

		  “infernal method” of etching his illuminated books “by

		  <name type="person" reg="Linnell, John">Linnell</name> dated 
		  <date value="03-06-1827">3 July 1827</date>, he mentioned a
		  “relapse” brought on, he thought, by a trip to 
		  <name type="place">Hampstead</name>: “I find I am not so well as
		  I thought [. . .] I have been yellow accompanied by all the old Symptoms”
		  
		  <bibl>(Erdman 785)</bibl>.

		  <bibl>(Erdman 775)</bibl>. Despite his symptoms, 
		  <name type="person" reg="Blake, William">Blake</name> expressed hopes
