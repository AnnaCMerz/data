    recommendations of the MLA's Committee on Computers and Emerging
    Technologies. (See that body's <A href="http://www.mla.org/reports/ccet/ccet_webpages.htm">Draft Guidelines for
    Providing Web-Site Information</A>, which suggests minimum standards for
    online documentation of Web sites "intended for use by students, teachers,
    and scholars in the modern languages.")</SPAN><P class="c3">All of this information is also (and has long been) available
    elsewhere on our site, but we repeat it here, in the concise format
    suggested by the committee, both for the convenience of users and as a test
    case for the guidelines.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><TABLE width="90%" cellpadding="20" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><TR><TD><H3>Sponsors</H3>
          A hypermedia archive sponsored by the Library of Congress and
          supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute
          for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of
          Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Sun
          Microsystems, and Inso Corporation. With past support from the Getty
          Grant Program and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.

          <H3>Purpose</H3>
          A free site on the World Wide Web since 1996, the Blake Archive was
          conceived as an international public resource that would provide
          unified access to major works of visual and literary art that are
          highly disparate, widely dispersed, and more and more often severely
          restricted as a result of their value, rarity, and extreme fragility.
          A growing number of contributors, currently eight American and
          British institutions and a major private collector, have given the
          Archive permission to include thousands of Blake's images and texts
          without fees. At this writing the Archive contains fully searchable
          and scalable electronic editions of 27 copies of 16 of Blake's 19
          illuminated works in the context of full, up-to-date bibliographic
          information about each image, scrupulous "diplomatic" transcriptions
          of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive
          bibliographies. By May 2001, the Archive will contain one copy of all
          the illuminated books, including the longest, <I>Jerusalem</I> (100
          plates), and multiple copies of several, along with a searchable new
          electronic version of David V. Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry and Prose
          of William Blake</I>, the standard printed edition for reference.

          telephone the project office at 804-924-4917 or send a fax to
          804-982-2363 (please mention the Blake Archive on the fax or cover
          sheet).</P><P/><H3>Update History</H3>
          Updates to the site take one of two general forms: silent corrections
          and emendations to the Archive's holdings and supporting pages, which
          are executed on a continuous basis, and public announcements (widely
          distributed via listserv email) of new materials added and other
          significant progress. The current Archive Update is available
          <A href="./public/update.html">here</A>; past updates are available
          <A href="./public/past-updates.html">here</A>.

          <P/><H3>Software Considerations</H3>
          The Blake Archive is best accessed using Windows 95/98/NT, Netscape
          Navigator 3.01 or higher, and a high-resolution monitor set to Gamma
          1.8 and a White Point of 5000K (as these are the settings used in
          color-correcting the inline and enlarged images in the Archive).
          Performance is equally favorable under Internet Explorer 3.0 or
          higher, but the optional Search History feature is non-functional due
          to JavaScript incompatibilities.

          <P>Macintosh users with a PowerPC should be using both System 8 and
          Netscape Communicator 4.01 or higher--this is the (Macintosh)
          combination under which the Archive's Java features perform most
          reliably. Users with a 68K Mac should opt for the non-Java site, even
          if they are running System 8 and Communicator 4.01 or higher.
          Likewise, Mac users running Internet Explorer should opt for the
          non-Java site.</P><P>Full documentation of Known Bugs and Hazards is available <A href="./help/hazards.html">here</A>.</P><H3>Citation and Permissions</H3>

          Copyright Â© 1996-2001 by Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph
          Viscomi, all rights reserved. Items in the Archive may be shared in
          accordance with the Fair Use provisions of U.S. copyright law.
          Redistribution or republication on other terms, in any medium,
          requires express written consent from the editors and advance
          notification of the publisher, The Institute for Advanced Technology
          in the Humanities. Permission to reproduce the graphic images in this

          <H3>Site Configuration</H3>
          There are two different kinds of HTML pages in the Blake Archive: the
          kind you usually find on the World-Wide Web (HTTPD-based) and a
          second kind created by DynaWeb (a product of Electronic Book
          Technologies, now part of Inso). You encounter the first, ordinary
          kind in our "top-level" pages (such as the Archive home page, project
          updates, and this help document). But when you go, for example, to
          one of Blake's illuminated books, you are using special DynaWeb
          pages. DynaWeb handles all copies of Blake's works and Erdman's
          edition of Blake's texts, along with all the searching of texts and
          images.

          <P>The Archive is organized hierarchically; at its top level are
          collections grouped by type, such as illuminated books, commercial
          book illustrations, drawings and sketches, and so forth. As you work
          your way down through these menus, your choices become more specific:
          illuminated books, for example, are indexed by title, and titles are
          indexed by particular copies of the book; particular copies are then
          indexed by plate. Plates are presented on what we refer to as an
          Object View screen, the most basic browsable unit in the Archive,
          corresponding to a discrete physical artifact such as a single plate
          in an illuminated book or a drawing or a single manuscript page.</P><P>Complete help documentation for the Archive is available <A href="./help/help.html" target="help">here</A>.</P><P/><H3>Credits</H3>
