  California, Los Angeles); Timothy Brennan (Univ. of Minnesota); and Leah S.
  Marcus (Vanderbilt Univ.), chair. The committee's citation for the winning
  edition reads:</P><P>The William Blake Archive is a dazzling combination of hypertextually
  organized texts, bibliographical and historical commentaries, and beautifully
  reproduced visual images, including thousands of plates of Blake drawings,
  watercolors, and manuscripts. In the past the prize has been awarded to
  single volumes in a multivolume series. This year's prize, similarly, is
  awarded to major scholarly additions to the archive published in 2001 or
  2002, including Blake's first group of twenty-one watercolors illustrating
  the book of Job and three copies of <I>The [First] Book of Urizen</I>. If, as
  has been frequently suggested, the future of editorial scholarship lies in
  online editions, the William Blake Archive has set a high mark for future
  editorial practice through its clarity, user-friendliness, beauty, and
  erudition.</P><!--This updates automatically- Leave untouched--><P><SCRIPT language="JavaScript">&lt;!--// Begin
