  announce the publication of the electronic edition of <I>The First Book of
  Urizen</I> copy B. One of eight extant copies--and one of two with all 28
  plates--copy B was acquired by the portrait painter George Romney, probably
  directly from Blake. Now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, it joins copies A,
  C, F, and G in the Archive and will be joined by copy D in the near future.
  The plate order for each of these copies is unique.</P><P><I>Urizen</I> is dated 1794 on its title plate, and the first six copies
  were color printed that year. Copy B was printed the following year and at
  first sight appears to have been color printed, but it was printed in one ink
  with watercolor washes and opaque colors applied in simulation of color
  printing. It was printed on large sheets of paper primarily in a light black
  ink, with hues of green and brown, as part of a deluxe set of illuminated
  books printed in the same format. Other books in the Archive from this set
  are <I>All Religions are One</I> copy A and <I>There is No Natural
  Religion</I> copy L; <I>The Book of Thel</I> copy F; <I>The Marriage of
  Heaven and Hell</I> copy D; <I>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</I> copy G;
  <I>America a Prophecy</I> copies A and B; <I>Songs of Innocence and of
  Experience</I> copy R.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
