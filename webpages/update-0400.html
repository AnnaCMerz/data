  it has received a two-year Preservation and Access Grant from the National
  Endowment for the Humanities. The editors and staff are most grateful for the
  support it provides as we begin to expand the Archive over the next few years
  to include Blake's drawings, paintings, and engravings.</P><P>We are also very pleased to announce the publication of new electronic
  editions of <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE> copies H and I, both
  in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Printed in 1790 and 1827
  respectively, they join copies of <CITE>Marriage</CITE> in the Archive from
  other printings: copies C (1790), D (1795), and F (c. 1794). Copy G, from a
  c. 1818 printing, and copy K (plates 21-24) and copies L and M (separate
  printings of "A Song of Liberty") from a 1790 printing are forthcoming.</P><P>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4 x 5 inch
  transparencies; texts and images are fully searchable and supported by the
  Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</P><P>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully
  searchable and scalable electronic editions of 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19
  illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each
  work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions
  of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable
  SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <CITE>Complete Poetry
  and Prose of William Blake</CITE>. With the forthcoming publication of
  <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE> copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of
  each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of
  most.</P><P><CITE>Marriage</CITE> copy H, perhaps the most illuminated of Blake's
  illuminated books, appears initially to have relied on colored inks rather
  than watercolor washes for its coloring. It was produced with copy B in 1790,
  with plates printed in various shades of red, olive, and green inks on both
  sides of the leaves. The impressions forming copy B (Bodleian Library, Oxford
  University) are uncolored, and those forming copy H may also have been left
  in this state originally. But copy H was sold to the painter John Linnell,
  Blake's young patron, in 1821 for two pounds and two shillings (less than
  half of what he was asking for books of similar size and number of pages),
  and apparently at that time Blake extensively reworked the pages by coloring
  the illustrations, adding gold leaf (e.g., title page), streaking the
  background of the texts in yellows and blues, and, what is most unusual,
  going over the texts in various colored inks, letter by letter, line by line.
  The results are pages among the most colorful that Blake ever produced and
  texts among the most challenging editorially, with many key words and phrases
  visually highlighted (e.g., "Contraries" and "Human existence" of plate 3 set
  off by dark ink in lines rewritten in red ink). Such detailed refinishing
  also resulted in a book with stylistic features characteristic of productions
  both early (facing pages and plates printed without borders) and late
  (elaborate coloring and page numbers).</P><P>One stylistic element characteristic of illuminated books produced c. 1818
  and later is the frameline, usually one thin line in red or black ink drawn a
  few centimeters around the image. Copy H has no framelines, probably because
  they would prove visually jarring for pages that face one another. But they
  are used to superb effect in <CITE>Marriage</CITE> copy I, where they set off
  each page as a miniature painting. Copy I, printed and colored in 1827 for
  Thomas Wainewright, was one of the last illuminated books produced by Blake.
  It was printed in orangish-red ink on one side of J. Whatman paper dated
  1825, numbered 1-27, and finished in gold, watercolors, and pen and ink to
  match Wainewright's copy of <CITE>Songs</CITE> (copy X). It was produced in
  the same style Blake used in c. 1818, 1821-22, and 1825-26. Works from these
  sessions include <CITE>The Book of Thel</CITE> copy O and <CITE>Songs of
  Innocence and of Experience</CITE> copies Z and AA, which are in the Archive,
  and <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE> copy G,
  <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE> copy E, <CITE>America, a Prophecy</CITE> copy O,
  <CITE>Europe, a Prophecy</CITE> copy K, and <CITE>Visions of the Daughters of
  Albion</CITE> copy P, all of which will enter the Archive within the year.
  Printing plates in full (i.e., with their plate borders), a feature of this
  late production style, can make pages appear slightly larger and introduce
  compositional elements missing in copies printed earlier. For
  <CITE>Marriage</CITE> copy I, as well as copy G, the inclusion of the plate
  borders introduced the outer lines forming rocks and cavern shapes on plates
  10, 11, 15, and 20, images named in the text but pictured only in these last
  two copies.</P><P><BR/>
