  announce the publication of the electronic edition of Blake's illustrations
  to Robert Blair's <I>The Grave</I>, accompanied by the related separate plate
  of <I>Deaths Door</I>. Both are presented in our Preview mode, one that
  provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our
  image annotation program).</P><P>The illustrations to <I>The Grave</I> are among Blake's most important
  commissions for commercially published book illustrations. The engraver and
  would-be publisher R. H. Cromek hired Blake to illustrate Blair's popular
  "Graveyard" poem in 1805. Blake produced one design, <I>Deaths Door</I>, as a
  white-line etching, but Cromek found this so unsatisfactory that he quickly
  turned to the fashionable engraver Louis Schiavonetti to etch and engrave
  twelve of Blake's illustrations. These were published, along with a
  frontispiece portrait of Blake included in our electronic edition, in 1808.
  Blake's reputation as an artist through the first half of the nineteenth
  century was based largely on these images.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
