  mirror site. Hosted at Oxford University in Oxford, England, the mirror is
  available at www.blakearchive.org.uk. The Archive averages 1,600+ visits per
  day, and many of these "visits" originate from British domains. Intended to
  improve access speed for our British and European users, the mirror can be
  accessed from our welcome and index pages as well as at the URL listed above.
  All Archive materials are available at both sites.</P><P>The Humanities Computing Unit (HCU), a division of the Oxford University
  Computing Services (OUCS), hosts this mirror. The Blake mirror is the second
  such partnership between the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
  Humanities (IATH) and the HCU. The Archive joins a growing list of Web-based
  humanities research projects that target and reach a global audience. A
  second Blake mirror in the Pacific is also in the works.</P><P>We would like to thank Conall O'Brien (Systems Administrator, Network
  Systems Management Service, OUCS), Kirk Hastings (Lead Programmer/Analyst,
  IATH), and Andrea Laue (Project Manager, William Blake Archive) for their
  efforts on this project. In addition, Lou Burnard (Manager, HCU) and John
  Unsworth (Director, IATH) should be recognized for their support.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries
  and museums that have generously given us permission to represent works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>At present the Archive contains 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
  books, plus a fully SGML-encoded electronic edition of David. V. Erdman's
  <I>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</I>. In the near future we
  expect to release a much-anticipated electronic edition of <I>Jerusalem</I>,
  copy E; the publication of Blake's longest (and perhaps most spectacular)
  work will render the Archive's illuminated collection complete, with at least
  one copy of every work and multiple copies of most. At that point, in
  addition to continuing to publish additional copies of the works in
  illuminated printing, we will begin to incorporate Blake's accomplishments in
  other media (paintings, drawings, commercial and original engravings, and
  manuscripts). By spring we also plan to publish collection handlists for each
  of the Archive's contributing institutions. Future supplementary materials
  include a biography and glossary as well as improved, searchable versions of
  our bibliographies.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
