  publication of the electronic edition of <I>Jerusalem The Emanation of The
  Giant Albion</I> copy E. <I>Jerusalem</I> is Blake's masterpiece in
  illuminated printing, and this copy is his greatest achievement in the
  medium. Consisting of 100 relief and white-line etchings divided into four
  chapters, <I>Jerusalem</I> is his longest illuminated book, and its plates
  are among his largest, approximately 22.5 x 16 cm. Though dated 1804 on its
  title plate, it was not printed in its entirety until c. 1820. Five complete
  copies are extant, along with one incomplete colored copy (chapter 1 only)
  and three complete posthumous copies.</P><P>Copy E, the only complete colored copy, is magnificent. All but one plate
  (51, in black ink) were printed in red-orange on one side of large sheets of
  J. Whatman 1820 paper, elaborately finished in watercolors, pen and ink, and
  gold. Each impression is numbered in pen and ink in the top right corner; the
  first two pages have decorative borders and all the others have one thin line
  drawn in red-orange ink around the image, setting off each page like a
  miniature painting. Blake is reputed to have worked on this colored copy well
  into his final years, though he never found a buyer.</P><P>Copy E, from the Paul Mellon Collection of the Yale Center for British
  Art, joins other copies in the Archive printed and colored in this late
  style: <I>America a Prophecy</I> copy O, <I>Europe a Prophecy</I> copy K,
  <I>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I> copies G and I, <I>Visions of the
  Daughters of Albion</I> copy P, <I>The Book of Thel</I> copy O, <I>The Book
  of Urizen</I> copy G, and <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> copies
  Z and AA. <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E will eventually be joined by copy A, whose
  plates in part 1 are arranged differently, and by copy I, a posthumous copy,
  presumably printed by Frederick Tatham, who inherited all of Blake's plates
  and art works, including <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E, after Blake's wife
  Catherine died.</P><P>As recipients of our Archive Updates are well aware, we have been working
  on <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E for several years. The challenges presented by its
  scope and difficulty made it an attractive laboratory, in effect, for
  experiments in editorial method. Many of the adjustments in protocols and
  processes that arose as solutions to the problems of creating an electronic
  edition of <I>Jerusalem</I> have already been introduced into other works we
  have published in the meantime. These include significant alterations in
  transcription, display, editorial notation, even in line numbering. We also
  took the opportunity to rescan all of our first generation 4 x 5 inch color
  transparencies at higher resolution on better equipment, producing digital
  images of exceptional fidelity and beauty that capture even the texture of
  the paper. This rescanning and color-correcting process took over two
  years.</P><P>The Archive now contains at least one copy of each of Blake's 19
  illuminated books, and in most cases includes copies from each of the
  printings of the books, for a current total of 49 copies, all fully
  searchable. In addition to the books, the Archive includes the engraved
  <I>Illustrations of the Book of Job</I>, generally considered Blake's
  masterpiece in traditional line engraving and the culmination of his long
  pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 watercolors
  illustrating Job (commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts)
  are available in the Archive in Preview, our mode of presentation that
  provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our
  image annotation program). Also in Preview are Blake's illustrations to
  Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso." Also forthcoming this year are
  Blake's engraved designs for Robert Blair's <I>The Grave</I>, Edward Young's
  <I>Night Thoughts</I>, and the Job pencil sketches, along with an illustrated
  Blake biography and glossary and never-before-reproduced copies of
  illuminated books.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
