  electronic edition of <I>America a Prophecy</I> copy M. One of 14 extant
  copies, and one of only four that are colored, copy M was printed c. 1807.
  Now in the Yale Center for British Art, it joins copies A, E, and O in the
  Archive and will be joined by copies F and H in the near future.
  <I>America</I> is dated 1793 on its title plate, and the first ten copies
  were printed that year followed in 1795 by two more copies. Copies E (1793)
  and A (1795) are from these two printing sessions. Copy O was the last to be
  printed, c. 1818. With the addition of copy M, the printing history of
  <I>America</I> is fully represented in the Archive. Copy M, however, is an
  oddity, for it was uniquely printed with no other works during a period when
  Blake appears to have been generally inactive in the printing of his
  illuminated books. It is the only illuminated book printed on Hayes &amp;
  Wise 1799 paper and with most of its plates printed in blue ink. It appears
  to have been printed while Blake was proofing various plates from the first
  two chapters of <I>Jerusalem</I>, some of which are also in blue ink. A few
  of these proofs will enter the Archive in the near future.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
