  Blake's first group of twenty-one water colors illustrating the Book of Job.
  These were created on commission for Blake's major patron, Thomas Butts, as a
  series of nineteen water colors c. 1805-06; two further designs were added to
  the group at a later date, probably c. 1821-27. While Blake had drawn and
  engraved some important designs based on Job in earlier years, the Butts set
  of water colors is his first attempt to create a pictorial narrative of the
  whole story, from what Blake believed to be Job's misapprehensions about God,
  through Job's torments at the hands of Satan, to the restoration of Job's
  physical and spiritual wellbeing. The later set of Job water colors that
  Blake executed for John Linnell and the famous engraved series were both
  based on this earlier, Butts group.</P><P>The release of Blake's Job water colors is particularly significant
  because it marks our first publication of Blake's "Non-Illuminated Works."
  This new "wing" of the Archive will gradually be populated with Blake
  engravings, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, and typographic editions. In
  the near future, we will add such important works as the Job engravings and
  water color illustrations to the poetry of John Milton, Thomas Gray, and
  Edward Young.</P><P>In the interest of publishing the greatest number of high-quality images
  in the shortest span of time, we are introducing to the Archive a new
  "Preview mode." Like the current presentation of Blake's illuminated books in
  the Archive, works in Preview will be in full and accurate color, with
  enlargements, and with searchable transcriptions of any texts, including even
  the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions that will not be available
  in Preview are image search and Inote. Thus, works in Preview will not offer
  descriptions of visual motifs, nor will those visual motifs be searchable.
  The advantage of this slightly reduced mode of display is that we will be
  able to add works to the Archive more expeditiously. All works in Preview
  will bear a clear indication that they are indeed in "Preview," both in all
  relevant tables of contents and on the basic Object View page. As we add many
  works in Preview, we will gradually shift them toward fully functional
  displays that will make image search and Inote available. The Job water
  colors announced here are currently available in Preview mode.</P><P>At present the Archive contains, in addition to the Job water colors in
  Preview, 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books, plus a fully
  SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry and
  Prose of William Blake</I>. In the near future we expect to release more
  drawings and prints in Preview; a much-anticipated electronic edition of
  <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E, fully encoded for image search and Inote; and a
  collection of handlists for each of the Archive's contributing institutions
  as well as improved, searchable versions of our bibliographies. Future
  supplementary materials include a biography and glossary.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
  cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
  generously given us permission to represent works from their collections in
  the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
