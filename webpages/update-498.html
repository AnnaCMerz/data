  the publication of seven new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated
  books. They are:</P><BR/><BR/><UL><LI><CITE>The [First] Book of Urizen</CITE> copy G</LI><LI><CITE>The Book of Los</CITE> copy A</LI><LI><CITE>The Book of Ahania</CITE> copy A</LI><LI><CITE>The Song of Los</CITE> copy B</LI><LI><CITE>America, a Prophecy</CITE> copy A</LI><LI><CITE>Europe, a Prophecy</CITE> copy E</LI><LI><CITE>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</CITE> copy F</LI></UL><P>We had announced <CITE>Urizen</CITE> copy G as forthcoming two months ago,
  but formatting the double-columned text diplomatically in SGML for both
  Netscape and Internet Explorer proved more taxing and time consuming than
  anticipated. Such are the joys and tribulations of electronic publishing.
  Solving the problems there, though, ensured diplomatic transcriptions for
  Blake's other books with double-columned texts, <CITE>The Book of
  Ahania</CITE> and <CITE>The Book of Los</CITE>. Together, these three works
  are often referred to as Blake's Bible of Hell or, simply, the Urizen books.
  <CITE>Urizen</CITE>, of which there are only seven extant copies, was first
  produced in 1794, color printed to form copies A, C, D, E (untraced), F, and
  J. It was printed again in 1795 to form copy B, which was produced as part of
  a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, and then one last time in
  c. 1818 to form copy G, which was produced in Blake's late printing and
  coloring style. The editors are currently working on copies A, B, C, and F
  and expect to have them in the Archive by the end of the year. <CITE>The Book
  of Ahania</CITE> and <CITE>The Book of Los</CITE> exist in unique copies,
  with only a few proof impressions extant. They were printed in 1795 and
  executed in intaglio instead of in relief etching, the technique Blake
  normally used for his illuminated books. Although their texts are printed in
  intaglio, their frontispieces are beautifully color printed from the surface
  of the plates.</P><P>With <CITE>The Song of Los</CITE>, which consists of two parts entitled
  "Africa" and "Asia," we complete Blake's other series of illuminated books,
  sometimes known as the Continental Prophecies, begun in 1793 with
  <CITE>America</CITE> and continued in 1794 with <CITE>Europe</CITE>. The copy
  of <CITE>The Song of Los</CITE> included here is one of six extant; all were
  color printed in the same printing session in 1795.</P><P>With fourteen complete copies extant, <CITE>America</CITE> is not as rare
  as these other illuminated books, but copy A, which was printed and colored
  in 1795 as part of Blake's large-paper set of books, is, along with copies K,
  O, and M, one of only four colored copies-- and it was the model for copy K.
  Moreover, only it and copy O have the last four lines on plate 4, which was
  masked in the printing of the other copies. The Archive will include copies M
  and O (c. 1807 and 1818) later this year.</P><P>Only nine copies of <CITE>Europe</CITE> are extant, and only two of those,
  copies H and O (1795 and 1818), have plate 3, the Preludium. The Archive will
  include both of these copies by the end of the year. Copy E, included here,
  was lightly color printed on both sides of the paper in 1794 and joins copy
  B, color printed more heavily on one side of the paper the same year.</P><P><CITE>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</CITE> copy F is an exquisitely
  beautiful copy, heavily color printed (especially its frontispiece) in c.
  1794, and never before reproduced. It joins copies C and J (both 1793), and
  will be joined later this year by copies G and P (1795 and 1818).</P><P>All of these editions have newly edited texts; all images in the editions
  were scanned from either 4x5 or 8x10 transparencies, nearly all of which were
  made specifically for the Archive. Like our other editions, these are all
  SGML-encoded, fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the
  unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous
  updates.</P><P>The Archive now contains sixteen copies of ten illuminated books. In the
  coming months, we will be adding copies of <CITE>All Religions are
  One</CITE>, <CITE>There is No Natural Religion</CITE>, <CITE>For the
  Sexes</CITE>, <CITE>Milton</CITE>, and <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE>, along with
  copies of books already in the Archive but from different printings. Our goal
  is to have the entire illuminated canon online this year. In addition, work
  continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <CITE>Complete Poetry and
  Prose of William Blake</CITE>, which we anticipate releasing sometime this
  spring.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, Joseph Viscomi</P><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="./urizen.G.P5.detail.jpg" width="581" height="410" alt="The Book of Urizen, copy G, plate 5, Library of Congress"/></DIV><BR/><BR/><HR/><P><A href="../main.html"><IMG src="../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake
