  electronic edition of <I>Europe a Prophecy</I> copy H. The only monochrome
  copy of the nine extant copies printed by Blake, copy H was printed c. 1795.
  Now in the Houghton Library, Harvard University, it joins copies B, E, and K
  in the Archive and will be joined by copies A and D in the near future.
  <I>Europe</I> is dated 1794 on its title plate and the first six copies were
  color printed that year, followed in 1795 by two more copies. Copies B and E
  are from the first printing session and copy K is from the last printing
  session, c. 1818. With the addition of copy H, the printing history of
  <I>Europe</I> is fully represented in the Archive.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
