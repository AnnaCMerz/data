  very pleased to announce the publication of our searchable SGML-encoded
  electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <CITE>Complete Poetry and Prose of
  William Blake</CITE>. The addition of the electronic Erdman means that the
  site is now inclusive of an even greater range of Blake's work than the
  approximately 3000 digital images that will eventually form the structured
  core of the Archive proper. Based upon the text of the 1988 Newly Revised
  Doubleday Edition, the electronic Erdman represents almost 900 pages of
  printed material, comprising the complete writings of William Blake together
  with David V. Erdman's original textual notes (Harold Bloom's commentary
  omitted). The original ASCII text file we encoded for the electronic edition
  was generously supplied by Professor Nelson Hilton (University of Georgia),
  whose own electronic concordance to Erdman is a vital online resource for
  Blakeans.</P><P>The Blake Archive's electronic Erdman is tagged in SGML using the Text
  Encoding Initiative DTD and is presented online using Inso's DynaWeb
  software. But we should note that Erdman's edition is an extraordinarily rich
  and complex textual artifact in its own right, and encoding and rendering it
  has proven a substantial technical challenge. For that reason we consider
  this a beta release, and would welcome feedback and bug reports from users
  <A href="mailto:blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu">(blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu)</A>.</P><P>We will be updating our electronic Erdman edition continually in response
  to user feedback, correcting any mistakes and adjusting the formatting. We
  also anticipate migrating the edition to a later version of the DynaWeb
  server, which will support keyword-in-context searching (analogous to that of
  a concordance) as well as allow for greater functional integration between
  the Erdman edition and the materials in the Archive proper. We plan to emend
  the electronic edition to correct errata in the printed editions of Erdman
  that have been discovered by the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group and other
  correspondents. Finally we intend to publish a Blake Archive Supplement to
  Erdman, which will allow us to add newly discovered Blake texts to the
  printed text, thereby making the William Blake Archive's electronic edition
  truly the <I>complete</I> writings of Blake.</P><P>The addition of our electronic Erdman is the first in a series of
  publications slated for this spring and summer. We will soon add two copies
  of <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE> to the Archive, at which
  point it will contain fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 41
  copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the context of full
  bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions
  of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive
  bibliographies. Soon after, we plan to publish collection lists for eight of
  the most significant collections of Blake's works. Fully encoded in SGML,
  these collection lists will be delivered online using Inso's DynaWeb software
  and will be fully searchable. Perhaps most significant will be the
  publication of <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE>, copy E. With this addition, the
  Archive will contain at least one copy of each of Blake's works in
  illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.</P><P><BR/>
