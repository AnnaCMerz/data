  announce the publication of electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to
  two of John Milton's poems, the ode "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity" and
  <I>Paradise Regained</I>. Both are presented in our Preview mode, one that
  provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our
  image annotation program). These two sets of water colors join the twelve
  illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" previously
  published. They can be found in the Archive by moving through the following
  categories: Works in the Archive, Non-Illuminated Materials, Drawings and
  Paintings, and Water Color Drawings.</P><P>The six illustrations to the "Nativity Ode" presented here are the set
  commissioned by the Rev. Joseph Thomas in 1809. These are now in the
  Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester; a second set, acquired by
  Thomas Butts c. 1815, is in the Huntington Library. This later set will be
  published in the Archive next year. The twelve illustrations to <I>Paradise
  Regained</I> may have been commissioned by Butts c. 1816-20, but were
  acquired directly from Blake by John Linnell in 1825. Both series show
  Blake's close reading of Milton's poetry, but a stylistic comparison between
  them reveals Blake's development as a water colorist from relatively broad,
  flat washes, typical of his work in the first decade of the nineteenth
  century, to his mature style characterized by detailed modeling and
  stipple-like brushwork.</P><P>We are also pleased to announce that the Archive is this year's recipient
  of the Prize for a Distinguished Scholarly Edition, awarded every two years
  by the Modern Language Association. This is the first time that the award has
  been given to an electronic edition.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
