    Update Files</A></DIV><P>February 12, 1998</P><P>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the
  publication of an electronic edition of <CITE>Songs of Innocence and of
  Experience</CITE>, copy Z. It joins editions of three copies of <CITE>The
  Book of Thel</CITE> and two copies of <CITE>Visions of the Daughters of
  Albion</CITE>. In the next week, these works will be joined by <CITE>The
  Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE>, copy D, <CITE>The Book of Urizen</CITE>,
  copy G, <CITE>America, a Prophecy</CITE>, copy E, and <CITE>Europe, a
  Prophecy</CITE>, copy B. All of these editions have newly edited texts and
  were scanned from 4x5 color transparencies made specifically for the Archive.
  They are all fully searchable for both text and images and are supported by
  the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our <A href="./all-updates.html">previous updates</A>.</P><P><CITE>Urizen</CITE> copy G and <CITE>Songs</CITE> copy Z were produced in
  Blake's late printing and coloring styles, c.1818 and c. 1826 respectively.
  <CITE>America</CITE> copy E is a monochrome copy from 1793;
  <CITE>Europe</CITE> copy B was color printed in 1794, and
  <CITE>Marriage</CITE> copy D was produced in 1795 on large paper and with
  some rudimentary color printing.</P><P>We will be adding second and third copies of most illuminated books in the
  coming months, with the goal of having the entire illuminated canon online
  later this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V.
  Erdman's <CITE>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</CITE>, which we
  anticipate releasing sometime this spring.</P><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="./urizen.G.P5.detail.jpg" width="581" height="410" alt="The Book of Urizen, copy G, plate 5, Library of Congress"/></DIV><BR/><BR/><HR/><P><A href="../main.html"><IMG src="../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake
