  announce the publication of new electronic editions of copies B and U of
  Blake's <I>Songs of Innocence</I>.</P><P>Copies B and U are a study in contrasts, yet both are from the earliest
  printings of this book. Copy B, now in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of
  Congress, was printed with fifteen other copies of <I>Innocence</I> in 1789,
  four of which were later joined with <I>Experience</I> impressions, printed
  in 1794, to form <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> copies B,
  C--which is in the Archive--D, and E. Unlike many of these early copies of
  <I>Innocence</I>, copy B still consists of all 31 plates originally composed
  and executed for <I>Innocence</I>. Like them, however, it was printed in a
  raw sienna ink on 17 leaves and exemplifies Blake's early printing and
  coloring style. The plates were wiped of their plate borders, the
  illustrations very lightly washed in watercolors, and the texts left
  unwashed. This mode of presentation, along with printing both sides of the
  leaves to create facing pages, emphasized the prints as book pages rather
  than prints or paintings. Good examples of printing and coloring illuminated
  plates to look like minatures can be seen in <I>Songs</I> copy Z, also in the
  Archive.</P><P><I>Innocence</I> copy U, from the Houghton Library, Harvard University, is
  an excellent example of printing illuminated plates to look like prints. Like
  etchings and engravings, they were printed on one side of the leaf in black
  ink and left uncolored. Copy U, which was printed with untraced copy V, had
  been dated c. 1814, because of some stylistic similarities it shares with
  illuminated works assumed to have been produced around that time. But, in
  fact, copy U is the <I>first</I> copy of <I>Innocence</I> printed. The
  presence of a unique first state for "Infant Joy" proves this sequence; the
  bottom part of the "J" in the title is missing in all extant impressions, but
  here it extends into the flower. Copy U was printed before copy B and all
  other early copies; the ink color, printing style (recto only), and lack of
  hand coloring suggest a date of printing before Blake had developed his
  special ways of producing his illuminated books and instead repeated styles
  and techniques long familiar to him as a commercial engraver.</P><P>Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
  they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the
  Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</P><P>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 35
  copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
  Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
  <I>Jerusalem</I> (forthcoming).</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
