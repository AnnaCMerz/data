  announce the publication of new electronic editions of <CITE>The Songs of
  Innocence and of Experience</CITE> copies R and AA. Copy AA has been
  reproduced only once previously, as a microfilm many years ago; copy R has
  never been reproduced before.</P><P><CITE>Songs</CITE> copies R and AA are both in the Fitzwilliam Museum,
  Cambridge, England. They join copies of <CITE>Songs</CITE> in the Archive
  from other printings: copies C (1789/1794), F (1789/1794), L (1795), and Z
  (1826). Copies O and V, from 1795 and c. 1818 printings, are forthcoming.</P><P>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
  text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and
  ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</P><P>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 39
  copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
  Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
  <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE> (forthcoming).</P><P>We are also pleased to announce that the Archive was recently named to the
  NEH's prestigious EDSITEment list of "Top Humanities Web Sites"
  http://edsitement.neh.gov/.</P><P>Copy R, printed and colored c. 1795, is of special interest because it was
  Blake's own copy and, with slight variations, provided the plate order for
  the last seven copies, printed between 1818 and 1827. This was the first time
  that Blake printed the <CITE>Innocence</CITE> and <CITE>Experience</CITE>
  plates in the same session. All copies of <CITE>Songs</CITE> produced before
  copy R--for example, copies C and F in the Archive--were compiled from
  <CITE>Innocence</CITE> impressions printed in 1789 (either from the raw
  sienna issue, as in copy C, or green issue, as in copy F) and
  <CITE>Experience</CITE> impressions printed in 1794 (either lightly color
  printed, as in copy C, or heavily color printed while <CITE>Experience</CITE>
  was still in progress, as in copy F). And copy R marks the first time that
  Blake printed plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl
  Found") as <CITE>Experience</CITE> plates; in the earlier copies of
  <CITE>Songs</CITE> he printed them as <CITE>Innocence</CITE> poems and
  transferred them to <CITE>Experience</CITE> at the time of compilation.</P><P>Though Blake printed the <CITE>Innocence</CITE> and
  <CITE>Experience</CITE> plates in the same session, he apparently meant for
  them to be separate works. He printed the plates in various shades of
  greenish and grayish black ink, but did not print the combined title plate,
  and stabbed and numbered the two parts as separate volumes. He produced copy
  R, in other words, almost exactly as he advertised its two separate sections
  in his prospectus of October 1793, where <CITE>Songs of Innocence and of
  Experience</CITE> was not advertised as such, but rather as "Songs of
  Innocence" and "Songs of Experience," with each part listed as a separate
  work and described as "Octavo, with 25 designs, price 5s." Almost exactly,
  but not quite, because copy R was printed on one side of folio-size leaves
  and its <CITE>Experience</CITE> had only twenty-four designs, since it did
  not include "To Tirzah," which had not yet been executed, or plate a, which
  had been used as a tailpiece in copies B-D.</P><P><CITE>Songs</CITE> copy R now has the combined title plate and "To
  Tirzah," but both were inserted late. "To Tirzah" may have been printed and
  inserted with the copy's impression of "The Tyger," which is watermarked "J
  Whatman / 1808" (the only impression so marked). Both plates were printed in
  a solid black ink, not the greenish and grayish black of the other plates,
  and are numbered sequentially as part of <CITE>Experience</CITE> (1-25) and
  thus must have been inserted before this numbering and the numbering, in the
  same style and medium, of <CITE>Innocence</CITE> (1-28). The combined title
  plate was also printed in this solid black ink, but it is unnumbered and may
  have been printed and/or added later, though almost certainly before copy R
  was sold to Linnell in 1819, by which time the pages had been given four
  framelines, the <CITE>Experience</CITE> pages had been renumbered 29-53 to
  continue the sequence of numbers in <CITE>Innocence</CITE>, and many
  <CITE>Experience</CITE> impressions had been recolored.</P><P>Copy R was produced with <CITE>Songs</CITE> copy A as part of a set of
  illuminated books printed on large paper, approximately 38 x 27 cm., the size
  of the "I Taylor" paper it shares with copy A. It was trimmed to 30 x 22 cm.
  when bound to match Linnell's other illuminated books. Copy R joins other
  works from the large-paper set now in the Archive (<CITE>The Book of
  Thel</CITE> copy F, <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE> copy D,
  <CITE>There is No Natural Religion</CITE> copy L, <CITE>All Religions are
  One</CITE> copy A, and <CITE>America, a Prophecy</CITE> copy A, and
  <CITE>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</CITE> copy G) and forthcoming
  (<CITE>The First Book of Urizen</CITE> copy B and <CITE>Europe, a
  Prophecy</CITE> copy H).</P><P><CITE>Innocence</CITE> and <CITE>Experience</CITE> were printed together
  as a single, combined work in 1826 to form <CITE>Songs</CITE> copy Z, which
  is in the Archive, and copy AA. Both copies sold for L5.5s., half what Blake
  listed <CITE>Songs</CITE> for in an 1827 letter. Both copies Z and AA were
  printed in the same orange ink Blake used ca. 1818 and 1821-22 (works from
  these sessions include <CITE>The Book of Thel</CITE> copy O, which is in the
  Archive, and <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE> copy E, <CITE>America, a Prophecy</CITE>
  copy O, <CITE>Europe, a Prophecy</CITE> copy K, <CITE>Visions of the
  Daughters of Albion</CITE> copy P, and <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and
  Hell</CITE> copy G, each of which will enter the Archive within the next
  year). Like the books produced in these sessions, both copies were given
  single red framelines, though the pen and ink page numbers (1-54) were placed
  outside rather than inside the frameline.</P><P>In the future, with the release of our revised site interface, users will
  be able to instantly compare impressions from various copies of an
  illuminated book within the same browser window. At the moment, users need to
  open other browser windows to make such comparisons. Doing so with
  impressions from copies AA and Z, however, is instructive and well worth the
  effort. Impressions from the same plate, though printed and colored in the
  same style, often appear quite different if the text was rewritten or an
  image was strengthened in pen and ink (either black or red). But this
  characteristically Blakean bounding line was usually necessitated by an
  otherwise illegible text or undifferentiated images. Overall, the impressions
  in copy AA were better printed and required less pen and ink salvaging than
  those used to form copy Z.</P><P><BR/>
