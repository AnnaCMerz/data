  electronic editions for two works in Blake's emblem series: <I>For Children:
  The Gates of Paradise</I> and the revised and augmented version <I>For the
  Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</I>. Through a numbered series of intaglio
  plates with inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake
  puts the course of human life from birth to death in psychological
  perspective. Some of the emblems form narrative sequences; others exemplify
  mental states and their reification in the external world. Blake etched in
  intaglio the eighteen plates of <I>For Children</I> in 1793 and printed all
  extant copies (A-E) in the same year. The copy published in the Archive is
  copy D, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.</P><P>In about 1820, Blake revised <I>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</I>,
  giving the work a new title, <I>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</I>,
  reworking the design plates at least twice, and adding three new text plates
  at the end (19-21). Plates 19-20 contain brief interpretive statements keyed
  by number to the preceding design plates. The final plate is addressed to
  Satan as the "God of This [fallen] World." Copies A and B were probably
  printed c. 1820. Copies C and D, plus a large group of impressions never
  collated into complete copies by Blake but now divided into what are
  designated as copies J-N, date from c. 1825. Copies E-I are probably
  posthumous. We now publish copy D, from the collection of the Pierpont Morgan
  Library, New York.</P><P>Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
  they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the
  Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</P><P>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 33
  copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
  Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
  <I>Jerusalem</I> (forthcoming).</P><P>Also, we are pleased to announce that a <A href="about/tour/index.html">Tour of the
  Archive</A> is now available online. Through a sequence of several dozen
  graphical screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduces
  users to the basic organization and structure of the Archive, the features of
  its interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and
  ImageSizer applications. The Tour is located in the "About the Archive" wing
  of the site. Available as the first link off our main table of contents page
  at the URL above, the "About the Archive" materials include, in addition to
  the Tour, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a Frequently
  Asked Questions list, a Technical Summary, and an updated version of the
  article-length Plan of the Archive detailing our intentions with regard to
  Blake's non-illuminated works--and more. We hope that the Tour, together with
  these other materials, will prove valuable both to our own growing user
  community and to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic
  editing more generally.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, Joseph Viscomi, Editors<BR/>
