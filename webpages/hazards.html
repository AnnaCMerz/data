  Archive</H1><HR/><P class="c2">What follows are known compatibility problems for several
  features of the Archive with respect to various browsers and platforms. We
  are doing our best to resolve these problems, but some of them are products
  of rapidly changing technology and because of that are beyond our immediate
  control.</P><P class="c2">Bug reports are welcome, and <A href="mailto:blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu">may be submitted here</A>. Your
  findings will be most useful to us if they are documented with specific
  information about your platform, browser, and a careful description of the
  actual problem or error.</P><P class="c3"><B>NOTE:</B> Users have experienced major problems viewing the
  Archive with Internet Explorer 6. These problems can be corrected. Click
  <A href="#ie">here</A> for directions.</P><HR/><BR/><BR/><H3 class="c4">Most Favorable Operating Conditions</H3><BR/><BR/><UL><LI>The Blake Archive is ideally viewed using <SPAN class="c5">Windows 95
    or higher</SPAN>, <SPAN class="c5">Netscape Navigator 3.01</SPAN> or higher
    OR <SPAN class="c5">Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0</SPAN> or higher, and a
    <SPAN class="c5">17" High-Resolution monitor</SPAN> or larger (you can
    determine your browser's version number by selecting "About" under its
    pull-down Help menu).

      <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>If possible, your monitor should be set to Gamma <SPAN class="c5">1.8</SPAN> and a White Point of <SPAN class="c5">5000K</SPAN>, as
    these are the settings used for color-correcting the in-line and enlarged
    images in the Archive.</LI></UL><BR/><BR/><HR/><BR/><BR/><H3 class="c6">Known Hazards for the Macintosh</H3><UL><LI>As a general rule, the Archive's Java features (Inote and the
    ImageSizer) are less stable on the Macintosh than on the PC. Mac users with
    a <SPAN class="c5">PowerPC</SPAN> should be using <I>both</I><SPAN class="c5">System 8</SPAN> and <SPAN class="c5">Netscape
      Communicator 4.01 or higher</SPAN> -- this is the (Macintosh) combination
      under which the Archive's Java features perform most reliably. Users with
      a <SPAN class="c7">68K Mac</SPAN> should opt for the non-Java site, even
      if they are running System 8 and Communicator 4.01 or higher. Likewise,
      Mac users running <SPAN class="c7">Internet Explorer</SPAN> should opt
      for the non-Java site.

      <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>Inote:

      <BR/><BR/><UL><LI>If the Inote window displays a "Ready" message but fails to display
        an image, resizing the window slightly will display the image.</LI><LI>We have found that increasing Netscape's alloted memory is
        beneficial to Inote's performance on the Mac: Preferred Memory should
        be set to at least 20,000K, Minimum Memory to at least 6000K. Switching
        your system's Virtual Memory on or off does not seem to make a
        difference.</LI><LI>For Mac users, text will not wrap properly in the annotation
        windows except in Netscape Communicator 4.0; however, Netscape
        Communicator 4.0 (Mac version) will not display <I>images</I> at all in
        Inote windows(!). This problem appears to have been corrected in
        Communicator 4.01, which displays both text and images properly -- if
        you manually resize the Inote window once Inote has loaded the
        image.</LI><LI>The annotation window may open its list of component descriptions
        at the bottom, rather than the top, of the list. Should this be the
        case, users can simply scroll to the top.</LI><LI>Finally, as a general rule, Inote runs slowly on Macs. Please
        resist the temptation to "overclick" your mouse when the program
        appears unresponsive; most probably it <I>is</I> working, and will
        perform if given a bit of time. (Too many clicks though, and it will
        crash.)</LI></UL><BR/><BR/></LI><LI>The ImageSizer:

      <BR/><BR/><UL><LI>On versions of Netscape below 4.01, the first time you click the
        ImageSizer's Calibrate button, it will launch a new window, but it will
        not put anything in that window. The solution is to click a second time
        on the Calibrate button -- the second click will bring up the
        Calibration applet in that new window.</LI><LI>The Info window (displayed after you click the Info button) must be
        dismissed either with "Close" from the File menu, or by pressing
        apple-W.</LI><LI>Occasionally, users will notice Java code displayed on-screen in
        place of the image. This appears to be a bug emenating from the way
        Communicator and/or the Mac process Java. The solution is simply to
        reload the page, or to try a different page, and then come back to the
        one that initially produced the error. Restarting the browser may also
        help.</LI><LI>Images dispalyed by the ImageSizer tend to load very slowly in the
        Macintosh version of Communicator.</LI><LI>The delete function in the Calibration applet does not work;
        however, users may restore their display to its original setting by
        altering the value that is recorded the Calibration dialogue box and
        clicking Save.</LI></UL></LI></UL><BR/><BR/><HR/><BR/><BR/><H3 class="c6">Known Hazards for Netscape Navigator and Communicator</H3><BR/><BR/><UL><LI>Users may experience compatibility problems between Netscape
    Communicator 4.6 and the Archive's ImageSizer applet. The symptoms are
    these: the first time you load an Object View page in the Archive, the
    applet will work properly. But once you select a second page, the applet
    fails to load (you will see only a block of blank space in the center of
    the screen); moreover, all of the links on the page are rendered
    non-functional (you must instead navigate through the browser's buttons).
    If this is a problem for you, the only solution we have at this point is to
    shut down your browser and return, opting for the non-Java portion of the
    site. If and when we correct the problem or discover a workaround, we will
    post it here.</LI><LI>The Javascript-based Search History feature requires Netscape 3.01 or
    higher; it does not, however, require a 32-bit operating system.</LI></UL><BR/><BR/><HR/><BR/><BR/><H3><A name="ie" id="ie"/><SPAN class="c7">Known Hazards for Internet
  Explorer</SPAN></H3><BR/><BR/><UL><LI>If you are running Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.x, you may not be able
    to view Java-encoded portions of the Archive. This is because IE 6 does not
    install Java by default. You may be prompted to install it when you
    encounter a Java applet, but if your browser does not prompt you, you can
    do a manual installation:

      <UL><LI>Go to <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.asp?">the
        main Microsoft download page</A>.</LI><LI>Under "Search for a Download," select "Virtual Machine" from the
        "Product Name" menu. Make sure the operating system selected in the
        "Operating System" pull-down menu matches yours, then click the "Find
        It" button.</LI><LI>A list of possible downloads will appear just below the button you
        clicked. All of the list components should be different "builds" of the
        Virtual Machine. Select the build with the highest number.</LI><LI>A new window will open with directions on how to download and
        install the Java Virtual Machine.</LI></UL>
      Installation may require you to restart your computer, but once you have
      done that, you should be able to view the Java-encoded portions of the
      Archive.

      <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>The image displayed in Inote's panner window may be distorted; IE
    version 4.0 corrects this, but seems in turn to disable Inote's scrollbars.

      <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>The Javascript-based Search History feature may not work; it has been
    optimized for Netscape 3.01 or higher, but appears to function with the 4.0
    generation of Explorer browsers.

      <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>If you are using the optional Search History feature, your browser's
    Back button may not be capable of returning you to the Image Search
    page-use the "Image Search" link instead.</LI></UL><BR/><BR/><HR/><BR/><BR/><H3 class="c6">Known Hazards for X Windows (AIX)</H3><UL><LI>The first few words of the text in Inote's annotation windows may
    appear truncated.

      <BR/><BR/></LI><LI>The ImageSizer's Info button does not function.</LI></UL><BR/><BR/><HR/><BR/><BR/><H3 class="c6">Known Hazards for 16-bit Operating Systems (e.g. Windows
  3.x)</H3><UL><LI>16-bit operating systems will not support Java. In order to take
    advantage of the Archive's Java-based features (Inote and the ImageSizer)
    you must be using a 32-bit operating system (such as Windows 95).
    Java<I>script</I> however, which is used by the Search History feature,
    does not require a 32-bit operating system.</LI></UL><BR/><BR/><HR/><P><A href="./help.html"><IMG src="../dwicons/help_urizen.jpg"/>Return to
