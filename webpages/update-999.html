  announce the publication of new electronic editions of <CITE>The Book of
  Thel</CITE> copy J and <CITE>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</CITE> copy
  G.</P><P><CITE>The Book of Thel</CITE> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page,
  but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the
  netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while
  Blake was working on <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE>. Copy J is
  from the first of three printings of <CITE>Thel</CITE>, during which Blake
  produced at least thirteen copies, printed in five different inks to
  diversify his stock. Copies from this press run were certainly on hand when
  Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793:
  "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs,
  price 3s." Copy J joins copies in the Archive from the other two printings:
  copy F, printed and colored c. 1795, and copy O, printed and colored c. 1818.
  It also joins copy H, which is from the first printing, and, like copy J, is
  printed in green ink and lightly finished in watercolors. Copy J, however,
  was recolored when two of its questions ("Why a tender curb upon the youthful
  burning boy!/Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?") on
  plate 8 were deleted. The lines were scraped away from the paper, apparently
  by Blake, since the washes over it--and those added to the other texts as
  well--are in his hand. This second tinting also included pen and ink
  outlining, the modeling of figures through the addition of complementary
  colors and shadows, and the over-painting of Thel's yellow dress with green
  on plate 6. Texts streaked in light yellows, pinks, and blues were
  characteristic of Blake's later coloring style and suggest that the
  recoloring occurred around the time the work was sold, c. 1816.</P><P>This refinishing may have been undertaken to make the book more compatible
  with the dark hues of <CITE>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</CITE> copy G,
  with which it appears to have been sold, and with which it was bound,
  probably by their original owner, c. 1816. In keeping with the poem's dark
  events and brooding mood, the hand coloring of <CITE>Visions</CITE> copy G is
  impressively detailed and sombre. Rather than tinting the designs with
  semi-transparent washes in single hues, as in the first coloring session,
  Blake layered his colors to deepen the tones. This style shows the influence
  of color printing on Blake's hand coloring during the 1794-96 period. The
  techniques used for copy G even include some stipple-like effects imitating
  the reticulations caused by color printing. Washes were also added in text
  margins on plates 5, 7, 10, and 11, with a splendid sunrise bursting into the
  text on plate 3, as in late copies O and P. Copy G is unusual in other
  respects as well. The frontispiece and title page are placed sequentially, as
  in copies O and P, rather than facing each other, but uniquely with the title
  page coming first. This unconventional arrangement is confirmed by Blake's
  pen and ink plate numbers. He originally etched numbers 2-3, 5-7 in the top
  right corners of plates 5-6, 8-10, but all leaves in copy G are foliated in
  pen and ink in a single sequence, 1-11,with the new numbers written over the
  old on plates 5-6, 8-9.</P><P>Copy G was printed and colored c. 1795 as part of a set of illuminated
  books printed on large paper and joins other works from that set now in the
  Archive (<CITE>The Book of Thel</CITE> copy F, <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven
  and Hell</CITE> copy D, <CITE>There is No Natural Religion</CITE> copy L,
  <CITE>All Religions are One</CITE> copy A, and <CITE>America, a
  Prophecy</CITE> copy A) and forthcoming (<CITE>The First Book of
  Urizen</CITE> copy B and <CITE>Europe, a Prophecy</CITE> copy H). It also
  joins copies of <CITE>Visions</CITE> in the Archive from other printings:
  copies C and J, different issues from the first printing of 1793, and copy F,
  color printed c. 1794. Copy P, an exemplary copy from the fourth and final
  printing of c. 1818, is forthcoming.</P><P>In Blake's advertisement, <CITE>Visions</CITE> was described as "Folio,
  with 8 designs, price 7s.6d." Copy G, though, was trimmed to quarto size when
  bound with <CITE>Thel</CITE> copy J. Both works are now in the Houghton
  Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</P><P>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 8x10"
  transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images and
  supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous
  updates.</P><P>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 37
  copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
  Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
  <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE> (forthcoming).</P><P><BR/>
