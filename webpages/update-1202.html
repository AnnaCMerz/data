  Blake's 22 engraved <I>Illustrations of the Book of Job</I>. This work is
  generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving, as
  well as the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of
  Job. His first series of 19 water colors illustrating Job were commissioned
  c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts. These are available in the
  Archive in Preview (see description below). In 1821, Blake and his new patron
  John Linnell borrowed this Butts set of designs. Linnell traced the series
  and Blake colored them. Blake also added two more compositions to this later
  group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier series, so
  that both sets now have 21 designs. The Linnell set led directly to his
  commissioning of the engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March
  1823. Blake began the project by executing a series of 21 reduced pencil
  sketches of the central designs for transfer to the copperplates. According
  to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a
  last-minute addition. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the
  production process. Although 21 of the plates bear 1825 imprints (the second
  plate was mistakenly dated 1828), Linnell's account books show that the
  engravings were not published until March 1826.</P><P>The copy reproduced in the Archive is from the first printing on laid
  India paper with the word Proof appearing lower right on all but the title
  page. Also included, as the first item, is a copy of the original letterpress
  cover label for the Job engravings. Our complete transcription of all
  engraved texts on each plate is the first to be published in any form. Both
  these inscribed texts and the designs are fully searchable.</P><P>At present the Archive contains 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
  books, all fully searchable. In addition to the Butts set of Job designs,
  Blake's illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" are also
  available in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features
  of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).
  In the near future we expect to release a much-anticipated electronic edition
  of <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a
  biography and glossary and more drawings and prints in Preview, including the
  Job pencil sketches noted above.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
  cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
  generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
  the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
