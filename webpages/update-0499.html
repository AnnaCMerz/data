  new electronic editions of Blake's satiric masterpiece, <I>The Marriage of
  Heaven and Hell</I>. They are of copies C and F, both of which are in the
  Pierpont Morgan Library.</P><P><I>Marriage</I> copy C, printed in 1790 in green ink on both sides of the
  leaf, was printed and colored in the style of early copies of <I>Songs of
  Innocence</I>. It has not been reproduced in color before. <I>Marriage</I>
  copy F was beautifully and heavily color printed on one side of the leaf
  (with copy E) in c. 1794. It was produced in the style used for <I>Songs of
  Experience</I> of <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> copy F, color
  printed in 1794 and recently published in the Archive, as well as for
  <I>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</I> copy F, also in the Archive.</P><P><I>Marriage</I> is the only illuminated book Blake did not sign and date;
  he did, however, pen in "1790" over line 1 in plate 3 of copy F, thereby
  clarifying the plate's allusion to 1757 ("and it is now thirty-three years
  since its advent"), the year of the Last Judgment, according to Swedenborg,
  and of Blake's birth.</P><P>Copies C and F join <I>Marriage</I> copy D, already in the Archive. Copy
  D, the Lessing J. Rosenwald copy in the Library of Congress, is also of
  bibliographical interest, in that it was printed in c. 1795 as part of a set
  of illuminated books that were printed on folio-size paper. This large-paper
  set also included <I>America</I> copy A, <I>All Religions are One</I> copy A,
  <I>There is No Natural Religion</I> copy L, and <I>The Book of Thel</I> copy
  F, all of which are in the Archive. It also included <I>Visions of the
  Daughters of Albion</I> copy G, <I>The First Book of Urizen</I> copy B,
  <I>Europe</I> copy H, and <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> copy R,
  all of which will enter the Archive within the next six months.</P><P>We now have thirty-one copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive.
  In addition to the books, we recently opened a new wing of the Archive,
  consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated and
  expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and
  Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation,
  and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Our hope is that these extensive
  documentary materials will prove valuable both to our own growing user
  community as well as to scholars interested in the theory and practice of
  electronic editing more generally.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, Joseph Viscomi, Editors<BR/>
