    Update Files</A></DIV><P>December 5, 1997</P><P>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce that the
  main research and development phase of the project has now been completed. At
  the present moment, the Archive contains three copies of <CITE>The Book of
  Thel</CITE> (copies F, H, and O) and two copies of <CITE>Visions of the
  Daughters of Albion</CITE> (copies C and J); all of these works are fully
  searchable for both text and images, and all are supported by the unique
  Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our <A href="all-updates.html">previous updates</A>. At this point we can now move
  rapidly into a full-time production schedule, adding new illuminated books to
  the Archive without pausing to address major technical issues. Because we
  expect that they will be widely used in the classroom, the first books to be
  added -- at or near the start of the spring semester -- will be <CITE>The
  Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE> (copy D) and <CITE>Songs of Innocence and
  of Experience</CITE> (copy Z). Others will then follow, with the goal of
  making at least one copy of each of Blake's illuminated books available by
  summer. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's
  <CITE>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</CITE>, which we anticipate
  releasing sometime in the spring semester.</P><P>Those of you who have been following our progress over the past two years
  will understand that we've reached a much-anticipated milestone. Thank you
  for your patience and continued interest in the Blake Archive.</P><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="./urizen.G.P5.detail.jpg" width="581" height="410"/></DIV><BR/><BR/><HR/><P><A href="../main.html"><IMG src="../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake
