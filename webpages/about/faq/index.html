        the Archive?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          The Blake Archive is best accessed using Windows 95/98/NT, Netscape
          Navigator 3.01 or higher, and a high-resolution monitor set to Gamma
          1.8 and a White Point of 5000K (as these are the settings used in
          color-correcting the inline and enlarged images in the Archive).
          Performance is equally favorable under Internet Explorer 3.0 or
          higher, but the optional Search History feature is non-functional due
          to JavaScript incompatibilities.

          <BR/><BR/><P>Macintosh users with a PowerPC should be using both System 8 and
          Netscape Communicator 4.01 or higher -- this is the (Macintosh)
          combination under which the Archive's Java features perform most
          reliably. Users with a 68K Mac should opt for the non-Java site, even
          if they are running System 8 and Communicator 4.01 or higher.
          Likewise, Mac users running Internet Explorer should opt for the
          non-Java site.</P><P>Note that both Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer allow
          convenient access to upgrades and new versions of the browser by
          selecting Software or Product Updates under the Help menu.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P class="c3">I've encountered a technical problem (bug) that seems to
        be impeding my use of the Archive. Can you help?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          We maintain a list of known bugs and hazards, available <A href="../../../help/hazards.html">here</A>,
          which you should consult to see if we have already documented the
          problem you are having, and perhaps offered a solution. If not, we
          welcome bug reports. Please mail them to <A href="mailto:blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu">blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu</A>
          and be sure to indicate the day and time you were accessing the
          Archive, as well as information about your browser (type and version)
          and operating system.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">I'm stuck with a slow connection to the Internet; is
        there any way to improve download times?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>Unfortunately, all we can recommend is that you opt for the non-Java
          version of the site; a link for the non-Java option is located on all
          "Index" and "Object View" pages in the Archive. We regret the large
          file sizes of our inline and enlarged images, but believe the large
          file sizes are justified by the need to capture enough
          high-resolution detail from the original artifact for the digital
          image to be a suitable basis for serious study and scholarship.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">Aren't there already dozens of Blake sites out there?
        What's special about this one?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          In brief, we believe the Archive is distinguished by the <A href="../editors/index.html">scholarly
          expertise</A> of its editors, the <A href="../../../archive/index.xq?java=yes">breadth of its holdings</A> (and
          the diversity of the <A href="../../institutions.html">libraries,
          museums, and private collectors</A> generously contributing them),
          and the very carefully chosen <A href="../tech/index.html">technical
          standards</A> and <A href="../principles/index.html">editorial
          principles</A> with which its texts and images are being prepared.
          All of this -- combined with structured data and sophisticated
          information retrieval technologies -- allows us to organize and
          assemble the Archive's materials in ways that would have been
          impossible prior to the advent of functional hypermedia systems. The
          Archive also functions as a testbed for a suite of advanced image
          manipulation tools that may well prove instrumental in carrying out
          other large image-based electronic editing projects.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">Is it OK to use the Archive's images on my own personal
        Web pages either for decoration or for educational or other
        non-commercial purposes? After all, that's not really the same as
        "republishing" them, is it?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>On the contrary, it is the same as republishing them and you may not
          use the Archive's images on your own Web pages without first
          obtaining the necessary permissions. Making an image (or content of
          any kind) available on the Web (even for recreational, educational,
          or other non-profit use) has been legally interpreted as publication,
          and publication requires the express prior consent of the copyright
          owner.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          The copying of materials from the Blake Archive is permitted only
          under the <A href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">fair use</A>
          provisions of U.S. copyright law.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">But if your images are publicly accessible online in the
        first place, doesn't that place them in the public domain?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          No. Publicly accessible is not the same thing as public domain.
          Public domain is a legal term, meaning that a given work does not
          qualify for protection under the conventions of copyright law. In
          fact, lots of material that is publicly <I>accessible</I> on the Web
          -- or in print -- is not in the public domain. That is why books that
          reproduce illustrations will often contain notices of permissions
          received from the copyright owner. Even though the reproduction of
          the image is being made publicly <I>accessible</I> in the book, the
          author or publisher still needed to secure permission to use it in
          the first place. Just so with the Blake Archive's images on the Web:
          we have sought and been granted permission to reproduce all of the
          images in the Archive and make them available to the general public
          as part of our online collections, but this does not mean that the
          images have been granted public domain status or that the owners of
          the originals have relinquished their claims to copyright.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">You've got some nerve trying to dictate what I can and
        can't put on my own pages. Do you think Blake would have wanted to see
        his work smothered by copyright laws? Why can't you just look the other
        way?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>Because the continued growth and development of the Archive depends
          on the goodwill of the museums and libraries that own the originals
          of Blake's work. If unauthorized use of our images becomes a chronic
          problem, there is the real possibility that one or more of these
          institutions will refuse to work with us in the future, thus
          undermining the usefulness of our collections to everyone. Moreover,
          we update and emend our texts and images on a continual basis, and we
          want the most recent versions of the Archive's materials to be the
          ones generally available; it is not in our interest or the interest
          of our users to have isolated fragments of the Archive in circulation
          elsewhere on the Web.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>The Blake Archive is a free site, open to all; we impose no
          subscription fees or access restrictions. We are endeavoring to
          create a resource of the highest standards and integrity for use by
          scholars, students, and the general public. If you care about a
          legacy for Blake in cyberspace, please respect our wishes in this
          matter.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">How do I know who owns the copyright on a given image?
        How do I go about contacting the owner? And what about permissions to
        re-use the Archive's <U>texts</U>?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          Click on the Â© symbol at the bottom left under each image in the
          Archive to find out which institution or individual owns its
          copyright. Contact information for institutions and individuals is
          available from our <A href="../../institutions.html">Contributing
          Collections</A> page. In most cases, permission must be obtained from
          the owning institution. We can only grant permission to reproduce
          Archive materials; please do not contact us regarding materials not
          present in the Archive.

        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">Why are some of the images copyrighted to the William
        Blake Archive? I thought you said the owner of the original always
        retains the copyright. And doesn't the Library of Congress have a
        special copyright policy?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          When the owning institution opts not to claim copyright, the
          Archive's editors retain copyright instead. For example, the
          copyright declaration for the Library of Congress states: "The
          Library of Congress neither grants nor denies permission to reproduce
          materials from its collections. When material from our collections
          are reproduced in a book or other media, we ask, as a courtesy, that
          somewhere in the item there be a indication that the original is in
          the Rare Book and Special Collection Division, Library of Congress."

          <P>Note, however, that this policy does not extend to reproductions
          of Library of Congress materials created by a third party (such as
          the William Blake Archive). The Archive's editors therefore claim
          copyright over their digital images of Library of Congress materials,
          images that they have created from their own (considerable)
          expenditures of time and money. Users wishing to reproduce Library of
          Congress images may not do so without the express permission of the
          Archive's editors. Likewise, copyright on materials from the Essick
          Collection is also retained by the Archive's editors.</P><P>The editors may be contacted at <A href="mailto:blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu">blake@jefferson.village.virginia.edu</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">I'd like to obtain a print of [a certain work] to hang on
        my wall. Do you know where can I find it?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          If you are interested in a print (or a postcard or a T-shirt) with a
          particular Blake image, it would be best to contact the owner of the
          work and inquire about reproductions of the type you wish to acquire.
          Contact information for the institutions contributing works to the
          Archive can be found on our <A href="../../institutions.html">Contributing Collections</A> page; many of
          these institutions also have gift shops which are linked from their
          home page.

          <BR/><BR/><P>Currently, one of the best sources of Blake posters and other
          reproductions is the Sales Shop at The Tate Gallery, Millbank, London
          SW1P 4RG, United Kingdom. (Mail order information for the Tate
          Gallery is available <A href="http://www.tate.org.uk/mail/menum.htm">here</A>.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">Is [a certain work] in the Archive yet?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          The best way to tell at the moment is simply to select <A href="../../../archive/index.xq?java=yes">Works in the Archive</A> from our
          main table of contents page, and examine the materials you find
          linked there. In the future we will be adding a search feature that
          will function as an index of titles in the Archive.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">I have to write a paper about Blake [or a particular poem
        by Blake] for school. Will you help me?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          Aside from the <A href="../../../archive/index.xq?java=yes">Works in the
          Archive</A>, you may wish to consult our <A href="../../../bibliography/index.html">General and Specific
          Bibliographies</A>, which you'll find linked from our main table of
          contents page. These contain up to date listings for approximately
          500 books and articles about Blake and his work. Use them as starting
          points for your library research.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">How do I cite material from the Archive?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          To identify the Archive as the source of information that you are
          using in a paper, article, or book, we ask that you include the
          complete title of the Archive, its URL, and the date you accessed it,
          along with the other relevant documentation. Here is an
          example:<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>

        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">May I link to the Archive?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          Yes, of course. You do not need to request our permission to link to
          the Archive, or to individual items within the Archive. However, we
          ask that your links to the Archive as a whole always be directed to
          our <A href="../../../main.html">Welcome</A> page
          (http://www.blakearchive.org), and that any links to individual items
          within the Archive also be accompanied by a link referencing that
          Welcome page. If your online document contains multiple links to
          individual items in the Archive, you need only reference the Welcome
          page once.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">What's the best way to learn to use the Archive to its
        full potential?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          By reading our help documentation, available <A href="../../../help/help.html">here</A>. We cannot recommend this strongly
          enough for any serious user of the Archive.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">Is there a quicker way?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          Even a close reading of the help documentation shouldn't take more
          than about thirty minutes, and we think most long-term users of the
          Archive will judge the time well spent. But if you're in a hurry you
          might either examine our <A href="../../../help/help.html">graphical
          help screens</A>, take the <A href="../tour/index.html">Tour of the
          Archive</A>, or read the document entitled <A href="../glance/index.html">The Archive at a
          Glance</A>.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">Are there ever public demonstrations of the Archive?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          The editors usually demonstrate and discuss the Archive at several
          conferences a year; more detailed information about such events is
          available <A href="../../demonstrations.html">here</A>.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">What's the best way to keep track of new materials added
        to the Archive?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          Either by periodically consulting the Archive's <A href="../../update.html">Update</A> page, or
          else by subscribing to our blake-update mailing list (do so from the
          Update page), which distributes approximately six messages a year
          about work completed at the Archive.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">When will the Archive be complete?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          In one important sense "never," given the open-ended nature of
          electronic publishing. The Archive is meant to be an organic
          resource, continually expanding and developing to support the needs
          of scholars studying Blake for a great many years to come. However,
          the editors expect to have achieved their primary goals by the year
          2002. More detailed information about the timetable for the project
          is available in the <A href="../plan/index.html">Plan of the Archive</A>.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><BR/><BR/><P class="c3">I sent email to you and never got a reply; how come you
        didn't answer?</P><BR/><BR/><BLOCKQUOTE>
          We try to answer or acknowledge all of the email we receive.
          Sometimes this may take a week or even more if your note catches us
          at a particularly busy time or if it demands extra attention from the

          without a response from us, feel free to send a reminder. It has also
          occassionaly been the case, however, that our correspondents have
          failed to specify a valid return email address in their browser or
          mailer's preferences, and so our reply has bounced back to us
          undelivered. To prevent this from happening, please be certain to
