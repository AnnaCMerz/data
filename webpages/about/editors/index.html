        California, Berkeley) of <CITE>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</CITE>.
        Eaves has published widely on Blake's theories of art in their
        historical contexts, including the histories of visual art, commerce,
        and technology, most recently in <CITE>The Counter-Arts Conspiracy: Art
        and Industry in the Age of Blake</CITE>. He is currently completing a
        speculative book on editorial theory in which Blake's illuminated books
        serve as a prime instance of the challenges of editing across artistic
        forms and media.</P><P><B>Robert N. Essick</B>, a major collector of Blake's work, has
        spent much of his career expanding and correcting the knowledge of
        Blake as an artist. <CITE>William Blake Printmaker</CITE> was the first
        reliable and comprehensive account of a fundamental but neglected
        dimension of Blake's career. Subsequent writings, such as Essick's
        catalogues raisonnes of Blake's separate plates and commercial
        engravings, have been models of their kind, not only accurate and
        complete but also well-informed by the critical and analytical methods
        of contemporary art history.</P><P><B>Joseph Viscomi's</B> experience as a printmaker and curator
        served him well in <CITE>Blake and the Idea of the Book</CITE>, a study
        of the production, editing, and dating of the illuminated books that
        has overturned much of the conventional wisdom about Blake's
        illuminated-book medium. The second volume of this project, <CITE>The
        Caves of Heaven and Hell: Reading the Illuminated Books</CITE>, is now
        in progress. Other writings on Blake include studies on the evolution
        of <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</CITE> and on Blake's market
        and reputation in the mid-nineteenth century.</P><P>Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi have worked together on two volumes of
        the new 6-volume Blake Trust edition of Blake's illuminated books.</P><BR/><BR/></TD></TR></TABLE><HR/><P><A href="../index.html"><IMG src="../about-icon.jpg"/>About the Archive</A></P><P><A href="../../../main.html"><IMG src="../../../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake Archive Homepage</A></P><BR/><BR/><HR/><!--This updates automatically- Leave untouched--><P><SCRIPT language="JavaScript">&lt;!--// Begin
