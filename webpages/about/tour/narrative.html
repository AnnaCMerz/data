          screen [</A><A href="tour1.html" target="images">show me</A>],
          <A name="2">by clicking a button acknowledging that you "Have Read
          and Accepted the Above Conditions [</A><A href="tour2.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="4">This button will bring you to the
          Archive's main table of contents, which contains links for: a set of
          supplementary materials About the Archive; information about the
          Archive's Contributing Collections; the Archive's General and
          Specific Bibliographies; a list of Related Sites; our Updates page;
          an area for User Comments; and various other features [</A><A href="tour4.html" target="images">show me</A>]. A link to the Archive's
          electronic Erdman edition will also be available here once that
          edition has been released to the public. <A name="3">The most direct
          way to access the Archive proper from this point is by selecting
          "Works in the Archive" [</A><A href="tour3.html" target="images">show
          me</A>].</P><P><A name="9">The Archive is organized hierarchically; at its top
          level are collections grouped by type, such as illuminated books,
          commercial book illustrations, drawings and sketches, and so forth
          [</A><A href="tour9.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="10">From here you may proceed to the index of all of the Archive's
          illuminated books (also known as a Collection Index) [</A><A href="tour10.html" target="images">show me</A>], <A name="11">and then
          from there to individual indexes of the various copies of each of the
          illuminated books (also known as the Work Indexes) [</A><A href="tour11.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="12">The Work
          Index presents various options, including links to a descriptive page
          containing a brief introduction to the work and a list of all copies
          extant [</A><A href="tour12.html" target="images">show me</A>]
          <A name="14">as well as a selective bibliography of secondary sources
          [</A><A href="tour14.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="15">The primary purpose of the Work Index page, however, is to allow
          users to select the particular copy of the work they wish to examine
          [</A><A href="tour15.html" target="images">show me</A>].</P><P><A name="16">At this point you will find yourself at the Plate
          Index for a given copy of a given work, which may also be thought of
          as the table of contents for a particular electronic edition
          [</A><A href="tour16.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="17">The Electronic Edition Information link (the first in the list)
          displays the "front matter" to the edition: a statement of
          responsibility and other documentation [</A><A href="tour17.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="18">Returning to the Plate
          Index, selecting one of the individual plates brings users to an
          Object View page [</A><A href="tour18.html" target="images">show
          me</A>].</P><P>Object View pages are the most basic browsable unit of the
          Archive, corresponding to a discrete physical artifact such as a
          single plate in an illuminated book or a drawing or a single
          manuscript page. The interface may seem daunting at first, but from
          here all of the Archive's most important features are directly
          available to you.</P><P>At the top of the Object View page, immediately above the inline
          image, you will see the title and copy of the work, as well as its
          plate number and its identification according to the conventions of
          three widely used print editions: Bentley, Erdman, and Keynes.
          <A name="21">Note that the title and copy designation is highlighted
          as a link: clicking this link displays our bibliographic
          documentation for the original copy (called "Copy Information"),
          including a printing history and physical description, provenance,
          and present location information [</A><A href="tour21.html" target="images">show me</A>]. This same Copy Information page is also
          available to you from both the Plate Index (by clicking on the
          highlighted title of the work in the Plate Index), and from a link at
          the bottom of the Electronic Edition Information page.</P><P><A name="20">Returning to the Object View page, you may access
          high-quality enlargements for the study of details [</A><A href="tour20.html" target="images">show me</A>], <A name="19">as well as
          descriptive commentary on the illustration from the editors
          [</A><A href="tour19.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="27">Every plate or image containing text is accompanied by a
          diplomatically edited transcription [</A><A href="tour27.html" target="images">show me</A>].</P><P><A name="28">Note that the copy information, the enlargement, the
          illustration description, and the transcription all display in
          separate windows [</A><A href="tour28.html" target="images">show
          me</A>]. This is an extremely important feature of the Archive, a
          premeditated aspect of its design. <A name="55">In order to use the
          Archive to its full potential, you should learn how to manipulate
          multiple windows on your computer's desktop, and also</A><A name="57">how to open new browser windows yourself to compare (for
          example) multiple impressions printed from the same plate
          [</A><A href="tour55.html" target="images">show me</A>] or multiple
          enlargements [<A href="tour57.html" target="images">show me</A>] . .
          . and so forth.</P><P>All of the features described thus far are available on both the
          Java and the non-Java portions of the site (a link that toggles back
          and forth between the two is available from every Copy Index, Plate
          Index, and Object View page). The Java site also includes two
          specialized Java enhancements (or applets) that we developed in order
          to take advantage of some of the unique editorial opportunities
          afforded by electronic environments.</P><P><A name="24">The first Java applet is called the
          <B>ImageSizer</B>, which consists of display area for the inline
          image and the button console directly beneath it [</A><A href="tour24.html" target="images">show me</A>]. The ImageSizer's primary
          purpose is to allow you to calibrate your monitor (or more
          accurately, calibrate the applet) so that Blake's works are displayed
          at their true physical size on your screen. <A name="22">Clicking the
          Calibration button will open a second window containing a ruler
          apparatus [</A><A href="tour22.html" target="images">show me</A>].
          Calibration is then accomplished by holding an actual physical ruler
          up to the screen and aligning the two. At that point, once you click
          "Save" and reload the Object View page in your browser, the image's
          onscreen dimensions should match the dimensions recorded at its
          bottom right. (Note that calibration is a useful but optional feature
          of the Archive; you do not have to calibrate if you do not want to.)
          The ImageSizer also allows you to manipulate the image in other ways,
          most notably by using the plus (+) and minus (-) buttons to enlarge
          or reduce it. For a full explanation of the ImageSizer and its
          features, see our <A href="../../../help/help.html#5" target="help">Help</A> document.</P><P>The second Java-based feature of the Archive is called
          <B>Inote</B>. Inote is an image annotation tool; it allows us to
          attach "virtual post-it notes" to selected areas or specific details
          of an image. These notes contain commentary written by the editors.
          (Inote is also used in conjunction with image searches, as explained
          below.) <A name="29">You may invoke an Inote session from the Object
          View page by clicking the Inote button located immediately below the
          ImageSizer's button console [</A><A href="tour29.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="30">Inote will open a copy of the
          image in its own window, along with a four-part grid overlay
          [</A><A href="tour30.html" target="images">show me</A>]. Each
          quadrant (designated as sectors A, B, C, and D, from top left to
          bottom right) may contain multiple annotations. Annotations are
          accessed by clicking on a particular detail in the image. If there is
          more than one annotation within the quadrant containing the detail
          you will be presented with a menu of annotations to choose from.
          Annotations keyed to the image in its entirety are designated as
          sector E. You may have any number of annotation windows open at a
          given time. Inote also includes a Panner feature, which is simply a
          navigational aid; it displays a thumbnail version of the full image,
          and you may navigate the copy of the image in the main Inote window
          by way of the panner. Note that the main Inote window also contains
          scrollbars. For a full explanation of Inote and its features, see our
          <A href="../../../help/help.html#4" target="help">Help</A>
          document.</P><P>There are two additional features available from the Object View
          page that are worth noting. These are a copyright declaration,
          indicating the owner of the copyright on the digital image (it is
          <B>not</B> always the case that the Archive retains the copyright) as
          well as restrictions on its use. <A name="26">The copyright
          declaration may be accessed by clicking on the copyright date at the
          bottom left of each image [</A><A href="tour26.html" target="images">show me</A>].</P><P>The other feature is the Image Documentation record for each
          image, which consists of textual metadata embedded in the JPEG header
          of the inline image. The Image Documentation record details the
          creation and processing of the electronic file constituting the
          image. It may be accessed by pushing the "Info" button located on the
          ImageSizer's button console [<A href="tour26.html" target="images">show me</A>]. Note that the Image Documentation record
          remains embedded in the image even if it should become separated from
          the Archive itself and may also be accessed using image viewing
          software such as JPEGview (Mac) or XView (X-Windows).</P><P>Thus far you've seen how to access the Archive's materials simply
          by pointing and clicking -- what's commonly called "browsing." But
          perhaps the most powerful advantage of electronic editions and
          electronic archives is their automated information retrieval
          capabilities. Computers excel at sifting and sorting large quantities
          of structured data, and the William Blake Archive has been designed
          to take advantage of these capabilities through its search features.
          Tasks that might formerly have taken a researcher days or weeks will
          now require just minutes.</P><P>Searches in the William Blake Archive take one of two forms:
          <B>text searches</B> or <B>image searches</B>.</P><P>The Text Search link is available from numerous points in the
          Archive, including all Object View pages, Copy Indexes, and Work
          Indexes. <A name="49">The Text Search link is also available directly
          from the Search the William Blake Archive page off our main table of
          contents [</A><A href="tour49.html" target="images">show me</A>].
          <A name="43">The Text Search page offers you a simple dialogue box to
          enter the text you want to search for, along with the parameters to
          define the search: the Boolean operator "Or", the Boolean operator
          "And", or the option to search for a particular "Phrase"
          [</A><A href="tour43.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="45">Hits are returned in the form of hierarchical lists that begin
          at the Collection level (illuminated books in this example)
          [</A><A href="tour45.html" target="images">show me</A>]; <A name="46">then the Work Index [</A><A href="tour46.html" target="images">show me</A>]; <A name="47">followed by the Copy Index
          [</A><A href="tour47.html" target="images">show me</A>]; <A name="48">and finally by a diplomatic transcription at the Object View
          level [</A><A href="tour48.html" target="images">show me</A>]. Search
          terms are displayed within the transcription in red. Note that you
          have an "Image" link available to you directly from the transcription
          which will display a 100 dpi reproduction of the image associated
          with the transcription (also available is an "Enlargement" link).
          More information about text searching is available in our <A href="../../../help/help.html#3c" target="help">Help</A> document.</P><P>Whilte text searching is a common option in many electronic
          editions, image searches are a more innovative feature of the
          Archive. Our image searching does not involve pattern recognition or
          computational analysis of the content of the images but rather a
          search across a rich and meticulously encoded set of SGML
          descriptions, creating a visual concordance to Blake's work.
          (Reliable pattern recognition and computer vision may be possible one
          day in the future, but for now just try to get a computer to
          recognize the difference between a tiger and a lamb, let alone a
          philosopher and a shepherd.) Like the Text Search, the Image Search
          link is available from numerous points in the Archive, including all
          Object View pages, Copy Indexes, and Work Indexes. <A name="49a">The
          Image Search link is also available directly from the Search the
          William Blake Archive page off our main table of contents
          [</A><A href="tour49a.html" target="images">show me</A>].</P><P><A name="31">The Image Search page offers not a dialogue box but
          rather a set of tables containing the keywords of the control
          vocabulary used in describing the Archive's images [</A><A href="tour31.html" target="images">show me</A>]. You may select up to 19
          separate search terms (also known as "characteristics") just by
          clicking them with your mouse; and you must also decide whether you
          want to search for objects that contain <I>any</I> of your selected
          terms, or search for objects that contain only <I>all</I> of your
          selected terms. (The latter is the default option.) <A name="36">Search results are presented in the same hierarchical manner as
          the results for text searches, with hits displaying first at the
          level of the Collection Index [</A><A href="tour35.html" target="images">show me</A>]; and then at the level of the Work Index
          [<A href="tour36.html" target="images">show me</A>]; <A name="37">and
          the level of the Copy Index [</A><A href="tour37.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="38">Note that at the Copy level,
          clicking the blue arrow next to a given plate produces a more
          detailed breakdown of your search results within a particular plate
          (which can contain more than one discrete illustration) [</A><A href="tour38.html" target="images">show me</A>]. <A name="39">Once a plate
          is selected, you are shown the descriptive editorial commentary for
          all illustrations on that plate, together with the characteristics
          assigned to every component of each illustration [</A><A href="tour39.html" target="images">show me</A>]. The characteristics you
          actually searched for are displayed in red. Note that the "Image",
          "Enlargement", and "Transcription" links are all also available from
          this page, and may be used in combination with one another [<A name="41"/><A href="tour41.html" target="images">show me</A>]. More
          information about image searching is available in our <A href="../../../help/help.html#3b" target="help">Help</A> document.</P><P>On the Java portion of the site, each component description also
          includes an Inote button. <A name="40">Clicking the Inote button
          beneath any component description will initiate an Inote session for
          that image, displaying the region of the image containing the
          searched for characteristics together with the corresponding
          annotation window and the navigational panner [</A><A href="tour40.html" target="images">show me</A>]. Note that while the image
          is initially displayed only with those sectors matching your search
          terms, the image is present within Inote in its entirety, and you may
          use the panner or Inote's scrollbars to view other portions of the
          image and examine additional annotations. The combination of Inote
          and image searching is a key feature of the Archive. One of the first
          major implementations of what is sometimes called "image-based
          electronic editing," this combination offers you an extremely
          flexible and robust apparatus for research and study.</P><P>This Tour was intended to give you a feel for the basic design of
          the Archive and some examples of various uses to which it might be
          put; it does not cover all features of the Archive or fully document
          the operation of those features it does cover. But because we
          recognize that the Archive is a complex resource, we have gone to
          great lengths to document and gloss these features elsewhere. Every
          page within the Archive contains the following "Help" icon which will
          open a second browser window displaying our Help documentation
          (already referenced at several points above) entitled "How to Use the
          William Blake Archive." You can try it now by clicking the Help icon
          below:</P><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c4"><A href="../../../help/help.html" target="help"><IMG src="../../../dwicons/help_urizen.jpg" alt="Help icon"/></A></DIV><P>The first few times you use the Archive you may wish to open the
          Help document right at the start of your work session and simply keep
          the window available on your desktop. <A name="53">Note especially
          the thumbnail icons for the graphical help screens we have
          constructed to explicate the basic features of the interface
          [</A><A href="tour53.html" target="images">show me</A>]. Clicking on
          one of the white text boxes within the graphical help screen will
          take you to the corresponding location in the main Help document
          where additional information about the button or feature is
          provided.</P><P>To return to the page from which you began the Tour, simply
