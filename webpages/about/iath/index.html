        highly successful example of networked collaboration in a scholarly
        research project. This project involves daily communication and
        cooperation among researchers, programmers, and assistants in four
        different locations, with only one face-to-face meeting a year. In
        spite of its geographical dispersion, this project group has worked
        extremely effectively, over the last several years: evidence of this
        effectiveness is in the Archive itself, which is a body of work done to
        the very highest editorial, aesthetic, and technical standards
        throughout.</P><P>In many respects, electronic scholarship in the humanities is still
        in its infancy: therefore, it is all the more important that we have
        examples to show that it can be successful--not only in innovating, but
        also, perhaps more importantly at this stage, in measuring up to
        traditional scholarly standards. The Blake Archive has done both, and
        in so doing has shown, definitively, that electronic scholarship is not
        an oxymoron.</P><P>Since the mission of the Institute is to support the research of
        scholars in the humanities, its technical innovations are driven by the
        research goals of its Fellows. The Blake project brings the resources
        of advanced computing to bear on complex problems in art history,
        including reproduction, cataloguing, and conservation. One of the most
        important challenges that the project has presented to the Institute
        has been the need to produce digital reproductions that satisfy
        researchers for whom color fidelity and image resolution are essential,
        while still accomodating the file-size restrictions of the Web. Eaves,
        Essick, and Viscomi have also been the first production users of the
        Institute's Inote software, a Java application for image annotation
        which is now a key element in the Blake Archive.</P><P>-- John Unsworth, Director, IATH</P>
