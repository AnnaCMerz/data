        archival, cataloguing, and editorial enterprises into a new medium in
        order to exploit its radical advantages. Until now there has been no
        base of knowledge and technology sufficient to conceive, much less
        execute, an adequate comprehensive edition of the work of a multimedia
        artist. The dominant tradition of Blake editing has been overwhelmingly
        literary. The historical Blake, a printmaker and painter by training
        who added poetry to his list of accomplishments, has been converted,
        editorially, into a poet whose visual art is acknowledged but moved off
        to the side where it becomes largely invisible, partly because of what
        one of Blake's first critics, the poet Swinburne, called "hard
        necessity"--the technological and economic obstructions that have
        prevented the reproduction of accurate images in printed editions. On
        the art-historical flank a productive scholarly tradition of
        cataloguing has been complementary to but largely disconnected from its
        editorial counterpart on the literary flank. Consequently, many
        students and even professional scholars know either the textual or
        visual side of Blake's work but not both, despite their
        interconnections at the source. Methodologically, the William Blake
        Archive is an attempt to restore historical balance through the
        syntheses made possible by the electronic medium. We believe that the
        resulting archival editorial prototype can help transform access to the
        art and literature of Blake's era as it helps to transform scholarly
        approaches to Blake. The methodology behind the Archive and the
        standards associated with it are, we believe, in line with this
        claim.</P><P>The editors have been working on several fronts to change the
        dominant editorial mode. The collective facts and arguments of four
        books, Essick's <I>Separate Plates of William Blake</I> (Princeton,
        1983) and <I>Blake's Commercial Book Illustrations</I> (Oxford, 1991),
        Eaves's <I>The Counter-Arts Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of
        Blake</I> (Cornell, 1992), and Viscomi's <I>Blake and the Idea of the
        Book</I> (Princeton, 1993) have laid the groundwork for the editorial
        transformation that the electronic Blake Archive is designed to
        accomplish.</P><P>In 1993, we made an initial trial of our basic editorial principles
        and procedures in two printed volumes, <I>William Blake: The Early
        Illuminated Books</I> and <I>William Blake: "Milton a Poem" and the
        Final Illuminated Works</I>. Their reproductions, based on large-format
        transparencies, were rigorously controlled for color fidelity, and we
        devised a multi-layered editorial apparatus that we thought optimized
        the presentation of books in which graphic and textual elements
        converge. Some fundamental tenets of the editorial approach that we
        applied to the printed volumes seemed precisely correct for the Blake
        Archive, and we have adopted and extended them; others, including the
        principle of selection, were almost inconceivable in print but are
        within the reach of electronic editions.</P><P><B>Principles of inclusion:</B> Our printed volumes in the Blake
        Trust series presented the best current information about the
        production of Blake's individual illuminated books, drawn chiefly from
        Viscomi's revisionist scholarship. But in those volumes it was not
        feasible to reproduce more than a single copy of each work--and many of
        the copies most relevant to the history of production have never been
        reproduced. We are building the Archive on principles that, while we
        cannot ignore practical limitations that apply to electronic scholarly
        resources as to any other kind, incorporate a history of Blake's
        artistic production for the first time into an edition.</P><P>As we indicated previously (near the end of Significance, above), we
        chose the illuminated books as our starting point for several reasons:
        their historical and artistic value, the editorial and technical
        challenges they present, their relative coherence as an extensive
        group, the difficulties that their fragility and their widely dispersed
        present locations have created for scholars, and a new map of their
        place in Blake's lifetime of artistic labor. We saw the illuminated
        books, once we had substantially achieved our first-phase goal of
        including one copy from every printing of every book, as a kind of
        archival and editorial backbone for the project.</P><P>That backbone supports a twofold strategy: to evolve along lines
        that will achieve the greatest possible coverage of the range of
        Blake's work while at the same time maintaining the greatest possible
        degree of scholarly coherence. (Maximizing the usefulness of our image-
        and text-searching tools is only one of several good reasons for doing
        so.) We maintain coherence by expanding the core with works that are
        closely related (historically, thematically, physically, etc.)
        <I>to</I> the core, and by giving priority to significant interrelated
        clusters (clustered by medium, such as the large color prints of 1795,
        by subject or theme, such as the Job and Milton illustrations in
        several media, etc.). Whenever possible, we assemble these individual
        clusters into larger ones. For instance, by the end of phase two
        Blake's work as a printmaker in several graphic media will be
        extraordinarily well represented--here again by expanding outward from
        the core of the illuminated books (typically watercolored relief
        etchings) to the other works designed and engraved by him, and then to
        those designed by him but engraved by others, and finally to those
        designed by others but engraved by him. We shall also incorporate all
        of Blake's typographical works, which are all rare or unique.</P><P>For details of our plans for expansion, see the <A href="../plan/#plan">Plan of Work</A>.</P><P><B>Fundamental units:</B> The priority that we grant to the media,
        methods, and histories of artistic production has dictated a feature of
        the Archive that influences virtually every aspect of it. It is utterly
        fundamental: we <I>emphasize the physical object--the plate, page, or
        canvas--over the logical textual unit--the poem or other work
        abstracted from its physical medium</I>. This emphasis coincides with
        our archival as well as with our editorial objectives.</P><P>Those central principles have too many implications to discuss fully
        here, but suffice it to say that they shape the entire editorial
        strategy, from the underlying structure of the SGML architecture, to
        the treatment of texts and pictures, to the user's dynamic position
        among those texts and pictures. The part-to-whole path reinforced by
        print--which typically starts with a reading of Blake's "poems" (often,
        in fact, transcriptions extracted from illuminated pages) and may or
        may not move along to a later, secondary look at "illustrations" (which
        often turn out to be a predetermined editorial selection of the
        pictures that seem most relevant to the words)--is reversed.</P><P>Perhaps the best way of describing our methodology is to present a
        brief account of some of its consequences, as they shape the choices
        available. (For a brief pictorial guide to the Archive illustrating the
        major points in the discussion below, see our <A href="../tour/index.html">Tour
        of the Archive</A>.) A user looking for a work in the Archive typically
        moves down through the SGML hierarchy that is fundamental to the design
        of the whole. The user selects Works from the primary Table of Contents
        page. From the <I>Works in the . . . Archive</I> page, the user selects
        a category from this comprehensive list:</P><TABLE width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="10" align="center"><TR><TD><H4>Currently Available:</H4><DIV class="c1"><A href="../../../archive/index.xq?java=yes">Works in the Archive</A><BR/></DIV><H4>Coming Soon:</H4><UL><LI class="c3"><BR/><BR/></LI><LI>Commercial Book Illustrations

        that category (Illuminated Books, the only category currently
        operative). Selecting a particular <I>work</I> (say <I>The Book of
        Thel</I>) in turn produces an index of copies available in the Archive
        (currently copies F, H, and O, Library of Congress). From this "generic
        work-view" page the user can link to a bibliography (for the work
        <I>Thel</I>) or to information About the Work, which provides a brief
        introduction and a full list of the extant copies of that work and
        their current locations.</P><P>Selecting one plate from an index of plates in a copy of
        <I>Thel</I>, the user moves to a reproduction of the physical object,
        perhaps plate 2 of copy F. This, the "object view," is the fundamental
        level of the Archive, to which all else is oriented. Here we integrate
        the reproductions of individual objects into an array of tools and
        information sources that allow further investigation of the physical
        object itself and of its meanings in context. Each tool and information
        source has a designated place within the total scheme, and each is
        available to the user by means of a hypertextual link--which requires
        only a click of the mouse.</P><P>From this point, our object-centered methodology can be most readily
        seen in the guidelines and standards we apply to the editing of texts,
        the reproduction of pictures, and the informational contexts that we
        supply for both, and, finally, in the tools we give users to create
        their own information.</P><P><B>Edited texts:</B> Transcriptions of texts are, in the terms of
        textual criticism, as "diplomatic" as the medium allows. That is, in
        line with the archival dimension of our project, our texts are
        conservative transpositions of the original into conventional type
        fonts, retaining not only Blake's capitalization, punctuation, and
        spelling, but also (for the first time in a complete edition) an
        approximation of his page layout. Unlike printed editions of Blake,
        which have typically chosen among the textual features of various
        copies to produce a single printed text, <I>the texts in the Archive
        are specific to individual plates</I>: each transcription is of a
        particular plate in a particular copy and no other. The arrangement and
        the contents of Blake's books often vary markedly from copy to copy.
        (<I>The Book of Urizen</I> is the easiest example--the arrangement of
        the plates is different in every copy, altering both the order of
        designs and the narrative sequences.) In general, printed editions such
        as Erdman's must not only extract text from plates that are composites
        of text and design and convert them to conventional type but also must
        represent "the work" as a single work--<I><B>The</B> Book of
        Urizen</I>--rather than as a collection of different visual and textual
        orders under one title. In such printed editions, differences are
        relegated to the editorial apparatus. In the Blake Archive, users can
        easily compare the texts of different etched copies side by side. As
        far as our transcriptions are concerned, however, our aim is to provide
        straightforward approximations--searchable and analyzable
        representations. We must recognize that they are, however accurate,
        necessarily approximations, simply because <I>any</I> transcription of
        Blake's irregular etched texts into the uniformities of conventional
        print is at best a translation. We feel no need to resort to elaborate
        typography and editorial sigla, the "barbed wire" that Lewis Mumford
        and Edmund Wilson famously protested in modern scholarly editions,
        because the Archive permits users to examine transcriptions beside
        superior reproductions of the originals by using the
        <I>transcription</I> button on each object-view page.</P><P><B>Images:</B> Fidelity in the reproduction of images is a top
        priority. Reproductions can never be perfect, and our images are not
        intended to be "archival" in the sense sometimes intended--virtual
        copies that might stand in for originals after a fire. But we recognize
        that, if we are going to contribute as we claim to the preservation of
        fragile originals that are easily damaged by handling, we must supply
        reproductions that scholars can depend upon in their research. Hence
        our benchmarks produce images accurate enough to be studied at a level
        heretofore impossible without access to the originals. In side-by-side
        comparisons, images in the Archive are more faithful to the originals
        in scale, color, and detail than the best photomechanical (printed)
        images in all but the most extraordinary instances. Our standard calls
        for first-generation color transparencies in 4x5-inch format or larger,
        with color bars and gray scales. (Our experiments with digital cameras
        revealed major disadvantages over conventional film for our purposes,
        and we doubt that we could obtain the necessary permissions to use
        digital cameras in most collections.) Once digitized (at high
        resolution in uncompressed TIFF format in a file that serves as the
        archival master for permanent storage), each raw image file is
        color-corrected against the transparencies--which are themselves
        checked against the originals--by one of the editors on professional
        equipment designed and calibrated for that purpose. The main
        object-view page provides reproductions at 100 dots per inch (dpi)
        compressed in JPEG format. That resolution is fine enough for most
        purposes and requires graphics files of modest size that facilitate
        downloading and movement from image to image. The enlargement (from the
        enlargement button at the bottom of every object-view page), which on
        most systems takes a few seconds longer to load for viewing, is 300 dpi
        (JPEG). The enlargement yields superb detail for close inspection of
        printing and coloring. Our standards of reproduction are, in short, as
        high as we believe they can be under the circumstances.</P><P>The structural priority we are granting to the physical object is
        apparent in our response to the art-historical principle that
        <I>scale</I> can be a significant aspect of the experience and meaning
        of an object. Thus we account archivally and editorially for the
        original size of Blake's works, whether plates, paintings, drawings,
        manuscripts, or printed pages. We have done that in two ways, by
        displaying the actual size of every object directly beneath it, and by
        providing ImageSizer--a new Java applet developed at IATH with the
        Blake project in mind--as a tool available from every object-view page.
        Retrieving the virtual object at its actual size is tricky, given the
        drastic differences among computer monitors. ImageSizer allows the user
        to calibrate and adjust, very simply, the size of any object--to
        display its actual size, or the size that fits the screen, or any
        convenient smaller or larger size.</P><P><B>Contextual information:</B> The Archive strives to be much more
        than the gateway to a vast pile of accurate reproductions and faithful
        texts. This would be "access" and "preservation" of a kind, but not a
        very useful kind, because access depends largely upon information. The
        Archive does its best to live up to the principle that works of art
        make sense only in context: the texts in the context of the pictures
        and vice versa, one illuminated book in the context of others,
        illuminated books in the context of drawings and paintings, and all of
        Blake's works in the context of historical information about them. Thus
        each object in the Archive is embedded in several sources of
        information, some layered, some overlapping, and some discrete, but all
        directly relevant to the "works" that are the contents of the
        Archive.</P><P><I>Copyright information:</I> Copyright may seem editorially
        frivolous, but it follows directly from our emphasis on physical
        objects, which raise property issues that could be largely ignored by
        Blake's literary editors when dealing with a "writer" long dead. The
        prominence of material objects in our schema also inevitably means that
        our daily editorial reality involves us in dealings with the owners of
        these objects for permissions and photography. The success of the
        edition heavily depends on our ability to provide an electronic
        environment where museums and collectors feel that their images are
        both well displayed and safe. To meet these needs we have gone to some
        lengths to investigate the laws governing copyright and to offer
        state-of-the-art protection, including digital watermarking; we return
        copyright of the color-corrected digital images themselves (with file
        copies of those images) back to the owner institutions (see our
        <A href="../../institutions.html">Contributing Institutions</A>).
        Considering the volatile state of international electronic copyright,
        controversies over fair-use policies, and owners' fears of illicit
        copying, we have come to regard our copyright policy as a key part of
        our editorial policy--thus all users must indicate explicit agreement
        with the conditions of use, including copyright restrictions, that we
        stipulate on our home page. Moreover, a detailed copyright notice is
        linked to every reproduction from the object-view page (the link is the
        copyright symbol beneath the image). Additional copyright information
        is linked to the Info button in ImageSizer beneath each image.</P><P><I>Information about using the Archive:</I> Detailed instructions
        are available to the user from all relevant pages (from the Help
        button; see our <A href="../../../help/help.html">Help
        Documentation</A>). To improve clarity, we have augmented verbal
        instructions and explanations with graphics, such as annotated screen
        images. This year we have added the extensive supplementary materials
        in the new wing of the site, About the Archive, which includes, among
        much else, the Archive at a Glance and an illustrated step-by-step Tour
        of major features.</P><P><I>Bibliographical information and metadata:</I> Each image appears
        along with its full bibliographical information (production history,
        physical characteristics, provenance, present location) at the level
        where that information becomes most relevant (work, copy, plate, etc.).
        Thus a user looking for <I>The Book of Thel</I> will find information
        about that work (comprising all its copies, or instances) linked to the
        "work" page. But all instances of the work are indeed embodied in
        physical forms--"copies." Copy information--on, say, copy O of <I>The
        Book of Thel</I>--is linked to every plate of that copy. When there is
        significant discrete information about the individual plate, that is
        provided by a link from the dimensions that appear below each object.
        ImageSizer is also configured to deliver (at the Info button just
        beneath the image) several kinds of information about the image. In
        addition to the owner, present location, contact information, and
        copyright restrictions, the information includes a precise history of
        the production of the reproduction itself from physical object to
        electronic image via photography, scanning, and color correction. This
        administrative metadata, the "image record," is embedded <I>in</I> the
        image file itself and travels <I>with</I> the image (if downloaded, for
        instance).</P><P><I>Information about designs:</I> The Archive provides information
        about Blake's pictures in several complementary forms at more than one
        level. Although information cannot be completely separated from
        interpretation, our emphasis is strongly on information and hence on
        description. (If interpretations are added to the Archive at some
        stage, they will be identified as such.) The meticulous descriptions
        themselves may have considerable significance, however. Many
        interpretations have been based on weak, partial, or mistaken
        impressions of what appears in the designs. And again, users do not
        have to depend ultimately upon our textual descriptions; when in doubt,
        they may examine the enlargements from one or more copies.
        <I>General</I> but fairly comprehensive descriptions of each image are
        available from the <I>Illustration Information</I> link on every
        object-view page--including, for example, the minute interlinear
        designs of Blake's illuminated books.</P><P>Inote, which can be invoked from each general description, will
        bring up the pertinent illustration in a separate window, with access
        to more elaborate descriptions of individual details within
        illustrations. The importance of images and their contexts to the
        project registers powerfully in this Java applet--developed at IATH and
        configured to the needs of the Archive--which is available from every
        object-view page and from the illustration-information window. By means
        of a location-grid/overlay metaphor, Inote makes it possible to view
        whole images, components (details) of images, and descriptions of any
        or all of them. When the user of Inote clicks on any sector of the
        image, the descriptions of all components in that sector appear. These
        descriptions are, again, specific to the image being displayed; they
        are not general descriptions that average (or enumerate) the
        differences among plates across various copies (instances) of a work.
        This level of plate-specific description has never been attempted
        before. Inote is also used extensively in image searches (see below).
        Individual copies of Inote are available for downloading to the user's
        desktop computer, where it can be used to record the user's own
        annotations for personal use, making the Archive interactive. (For
        technical details see our <A href="../tech/index.html">Technical
        Summary</A>.)</P><P><B>User-generated information.</B> The principle that information
        and access are correlative is nowhere more evident than in the user's
        ability to conduct comprehensive searches on texts and images in the
        Archive. The power of those searches depends upon the information
        (about the content of designs, for instance) that we provide; users can
        employ that information in turn to gain access to additional
        information and, ultimately, to create new combinations of information
        relevant to their specific interests (in Blake's use of a visual and/or
        textual motif, for example).</P><P><I>Text searches:</I> From most pages in the Archive, including all
        object-view pages, the user can launch searches for any text in the
        Archive. At the moment the searchable texts are restricted to Blake's
        works, but the aim is to make <I>all</I> texts in the Archive
        searchable--including image descriptions, provenances, and image
        records. (This would be one of the goals of the NEH grant period.)
        Searches produce lists of matches or "hits" indexed by category, work,
        copy, and plate; choosing among those, the user is taken to
        transcriptions where the search-terms are highlighted in color. The
        search mechanism is, again, oriented to the individual object. (Users
        who want more conventional text searches that treat a poem as a single
        "work" will have the option of searching the electronic version of
        Erdman's edition in the Archive.)</P><P><I>Image Searches:</I> Similarly, the user can launch searches for
        virtually any combination of details in any and all of Blake's images.
        This capability--unique as far as we know--has been made possible by
        combining the resources of SGML, DynaWeb (our search engine), Inote,
        and a system of image description, developed by the editors, which
        employs a controlled vocabulary of <I>characteristics</I>. (For an
        explanation of how we arrived at our system, see History, year 2,
        1996-97, above.) These search terms are organized for easy reference in
        a set of commonsense categories (figure--including character types and
        names, postures, gestures, etc.--animal, vegetation, object, structure,
        and text). The user can define a search using up to 19 terms at once
        (thus, for instance, simply "male"--a huge category--or, more limited,
        "bearded" "nude" "males" who are "crouching" in "fire" and "holding"
        "swords"). Like a text search, an image search produces a list of hits;
        choosing among those, the user is taken to textual descriptions of
        particular image details and then, choosing among those in turn, taken
        (via Inote) <I>to plates zoomed to specific image-details displayed
        alongside the pertinent descriptions</I>. At the zoomed image, all the
        functions of Inote are available should a user wish to explore the
        whole image in which the detail appears or study any or all of the
        other descriptions associated with the image.</P><P>A final word on our editorial methodology. Although the Blake
        Archive is constructed on an archival editorial rationale that we
        believe is sound and fully justified, the overriding goal of the
        editors is not the maintenance of theoretical purity but the creation
        of a superlatively useful and durable scholarly (and pedagogical)
        resource that will be available free to all who have the means of
        access. Thus, although our online discussion group <I>blake-proj</I> is
        full of daily debates over minute editorial issues, we had no
        difficulty agreeing that we should incorporate David V. Erdman's
        standard printed edition of <I>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William
        Blake</I> and make its texts searchable right along with the rest of
        the Archive. Though it is a fine edition in its own terms, we are
        including it not because it jibes with our theories about editing Blake
        but because we want the Archive to be much more than an edition, and we
        want it to be as convenient as possible to its users, who will often
        visit the site with Erdman's edition as their point of departure. By
        similar reasoning, we have provided an extensive (and eventually
        searchable) bibliography of reference works, biography, and criticism,
        which we shall revise and augment at intervals--the first of what we
        hope will be many supplementary study aids.</P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR/><P><A href="../index.html"><IMG src="../about-icon.jpg"/>About the Archive</A></P><P><A href="../../../main.html"><IMG src="../../../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake Archive Homepage</A></P><BR/><BR/><HR/><!--This updates automatically- Leave untouched--><P><SCRIPT language="JavaScript">&lt;!--// Begin
