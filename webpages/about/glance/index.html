        paintings, and poems of William Blake (1757-1827) has increased to a
        degree that would have astonished his contemporaries. Today both his
        poetry and visual art in several media are admired by a global
        audience. In the broadest terms, the William Blake Archive is a
        contemporary response to the needs of this dispersed and various
        audience of readers and viewers and to the corresponding needs of the
        collections where Blake's original works are currently held.</P><P>A free site on the World Wide Web since 1996 (<A href="../../../main.html">http://www.blakearchive.org</A>), the Blake
        Archive was conceived as an international public resource that would
        provide unified access to major works of visual and literary art that
        are highly disparate, widely dispersed, and more and more often
        severely restricted as a result of their value, rarity, and extreme
        fragility. A growing number of <A href="../../institutions.html">contributors</A> have given the Archive
        permission to include thousands of Blake's images and texts without
        fees.</P><P>Through intensive collaboration between the <A href="../editors/index.html">editors</A> and the <A href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities</A>, the Archive has been able to achieve exceptionally
        high <A href="../tech/index.html">standards</A> of site construction,
        digital reproduction, and <A href="../principles/index.html">electronic
        editing</A> that are, we believe, models of their kind. Advanced
        principles of design allow the Blake Archive to integrate editions,
        catalogues, databases, and scholarly tools into one electronic archival
        resource. We supply <I>reproductions</I> that are more accurate in
        color, detail, and scale than the finest commercially published
        photomechanical reproductions and <I>texts</I> that are more faithful
        to Blake's own than any collected edition has provided. We have applied
        equally high standards in supplying a wealth of contextual information,
        which includes full and accurate bibliographical details and meticulous
        descriptions of the content of each image. Finally, users of the
        Archive can attain a new degree of access to these works through the
        combination of powerful text-searching and (for the first time in any
        medium) advanced image-searching tools that are made possible by the
        editors' controlled vocabulary, detailed image descriptions, and
        innovative software, including two custom-designed Java applets.
        Although we have designed the Archive to serve scholars and general
        public within the limits of existing systems, we have built in
        considerable allowance for future improvements in hardware and
        software.</P><P>The first phase of development, underwritten by the Getty Grant
        Program with help from other sponsors, concentrated on the fundamentals
        of site design and the incorporation of a group of Blake's illuminated
        books selected on sound historical principles drawn from recent
        revisionist scholarship. In the second phase (1999-2003), we completed
        the design work, incorporated additional illuminated books, and added
        non-illuminated materials--paintings, drawings, original and
        reproductive prints, manuscripts, and rare or unique typographic
        works-that both expand the core coherently and exemplify the full range
        of Blake's achievement.</P><P>Doing so yields an augmented "Blake" considerably larger than the
        one most familiar to students and scholars. Without sacrificing the
        Blake of the <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> and <I>The
        Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I>, the extended archive will gradually
        reveal the painter-printmaker whose illuminated books emerged from the
        materials, work routines, and imagery of eighteenth-century history
        painting, watercolor drawing, and graphic arts, as well as from the
        <I>literary</I> routines of Milton, the Bible, Swedenborg, and Boehme,
        which students of Blake have more often investigated. Commercial
        illustrations, for example, can bring into focus a major convergence
        between Blake's illuminated book <I>Visions of the Daughters of
        Albion</I> (1793) and his engravings to J. G. Stedman's <I>Narrative,
        of a Five Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of
        Surinam</I> (etched 1791). Even the familiar profile of a poet-Blake
        can be deepened by the inclusion of Blake's extensive group of literary
        illustrations, such as those to Milton's poems, which should be seen in
        connection with Blake's 50-plate illuminated book <I>Milton</I>.</P><P>By the end of 2003 the Archive contained fully searchable and
        scalable electronic editions of many copies of all of Blake's 19
        illuminated works in the context of full, up-to-date bibliographic
        information about each image, scrupulous "diplomatic" transcriptions of
        all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, extensive
        bibliographies, a searchable electronic version of the standard printed
        edition, and other essential scholarly information, plus a steadily
        growing representation of Blake's works in other artistic media. This
        extended Archive aims to set a new standard of accessibility to a vast
        array of visual and textual materials that are central to an adequate
        grasp of the British art and literature of the eighteenth and
        nineteenth centuries.</P><P>We are hoping, of course, that the Archive, once extended to
        encompass the full range of Blake's work, will ultimately set a new
        standard of accessibility to a vast collection of visual and textual
        materials that are central to an adequate grasp of the art and
        literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But we have also
        come to see the Blake project as a pacesetting instance of a
        fundamental shift in the ideas of "archive," "catalogue," and "edition"
        as both processes and products. Though "edition" and "archive" are the
        terms we have fallen back on, in fact we have envisioned a unique
        resource unlike any other currently available--a hybrid all-in-one
        edition, catalogue, database, and set of scholarly tools capable of
        taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by new information
        technology.</P><P>The collaborative procedures we have begun to develop, which we hope
        will become useful prototypes of "distance editing," depend upon the
        intensive day-to-day teamwork among the three editors and the staff of
        IATH to integrate the textual, art-historical, critical, and technical
        expertise necessary for the construction of a scholarly resource as
        complex as this one. We see the products of our collaboration as
        similarly prototypical: in facing new technical and editorial
        challenges, the Blake project will leave future archivers, editors, and
        cataloguers the benefits of new tools. The Document Type Definition
        (DTD) developed by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) has become the
        default standard for encoded electronic texts. We believe that its
        standard counterpart for encoded electronic <I>images</I> may well turn
        out to be the evolving Blake Archive DTD. In this image-oriented
        non-TEI DTD--an art historian's DTD if you will--we are constructing
        the most comprehensive <I>applied</I> product of its kind, one robust
        and flexible enough to be readily adapted to the needs of many other
        projects. In addition, software developed by IATH, such as our Java
        applets Inote and ImageSizer, will be adaptable to virtually any
        project in which images are important.</P><P>Because the signal advantage of electronic editing and cataloguing
        is the open-endedness that makes it possible to add materials, correct
        errors, incorporate new discoveries, and construct new relationships,
        we have believed from the first that our principal objective--the most
        significant contribution we can hope to make--should be the creation of
        a sound and durable foundation for decades of future scholarship. Since
        1995, when the Getty Grant Program underwrote the initial phase of our
        project, we have worked to shape the foundations of the Archive in
        strict accordance with our original ideals and priorities.</P><A name="started" id="started"/><HR class="c4" noshade="noshade" width="50%"/><BR/><BR/><H2 class="c5">Getting Started with the Archive</H2><P class="c3">To browse works in the Archive, select <A href="../../../archive/index.xq?java=yes">Works in the Archive</A> from the

        text, select <A href="../../../archive/search.xq?java=yes">Search the
        Blake Archive</A> from the main table of contents page.</P><P>The Archive is organized hierarchically; at its top level are
        collections grouped by type, such as illuminated books, commercial book
        illustrations, drawings and sketches, and so forth. As you work your
        way down through these menus, your choices become more specific:
        illuminated books, for example, are indexed by title, and titles are
        indexed by particular copies of the book; particular copies are then
        indexed by plate. Plates are presented on what we refer to as an Object
        View screen, the most basic browsable unit in the Archive,
        corresponding to a discrete physical artifact such as a single plate in
        an illuminated book or a drawing or a single manuscript page.</P><P>We are aware that the Archive is a more complex resource than the
        average Web site, but we believe this complexity is an outgrowth of the
        very high <A href="../principles/index.html">scholarly</A> and <A href="../tech/index.html">technical</A> standards we have set for ourselves
        rather than a symptom of poor design and implementation. Consequently,
        we have gone to great lengths to ensure that adequate <A target="help" href="../../../help/help.html">help documentation</A> is available to
        our users and cannot recommend strongly enough that you take a bit of
        time to examine its contents. However, the following graphical help
        screens serve as quick reference guides to the Archive's basic
        interface and design features; clicking one of the thumbnails below
        will summon a full-sized version of the image, different areas of which
        are glossed and linked (click within the gloss) to further commentary
