        apparatus for the <I>William Blake Archive</I> are distributed across
        four file servers on two separate machines: an Apache HTTPD server and
        a DynaWeb server operating on a Sun Enterprise 420R
        (jefferson.village.virginia.edu), and an Apache HTTPD server and a
        DynaWeb server operating on a Sun Enterprise 420R. Both
        jefferson.village and dazzle.village run versions of the UNIX operating
        system. Both machines are located and maintained at the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), at the University of
        Virginia in Charlottesville. Since December 2001, the public Archive
        has been mirrored on a Sun server located at Oxford University and
        maintained by Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS).</P><H3 class="c3">Imaging</H3><P><B>Scanning:</B> Digital images are scanned from three types of
        source media: 4x5-inch transparencies and 8x10-inch transparencies
        (both of which include color bars and gray scales to ensure color
        fidelity), and 35mm slides. The transparencies are verified for color
        accuracy against the original artifact by the photographer and often by
        an editor as well. In the past, transparencies were scanned on a
        Microtek Scanmaker III with a transparent media adapter. Beginning in
        May of 1998, transparencies were scanned on a Microtek Scanmaker V.
        This model offers two advances: a separate drawer to hold 4x5-inch film
        inside the scanner's body and Microtek's EDIT (Emulsion Direct Imaging
        Technology) system. Since 2002, transparencies have been scanned on a
        Microtek ArtixScan 1100, an advanced version of the Scanmaker V. Slides
        (which are only occasionally used in the Archive) are scanned on a
        Nikon LS-3510AF Slide Scanner and a Microtek 35t Plus Scanner.</P><P>Current versions of Microtek's ScanWizard software (3.1.2PPC) are
        used with the two flatbeds; the Nikon runs version 4.5.1 of its
        supporting plug-in. The Microtek III flatbed and the Nikon slide
        scanner were attached to a Macintosh PowerPC; the Microtek Scanmaker V
        is attached to a Macintosh G3; the Microtek 35t Plus is attached to a
        Macintosh 8600 PowerPC. All three Macs run OS 8.1. The Microtek
        ArtixScan 1100 is attached to a Dual 1 GHz Power Mac G4 running on OS
        9.2.</P><P>We began with a baseline standard for all scanned images of 24-bit
        color and a resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi). All scanned images
        are scaled against the source dimensions of the original artifact so as
        to display at true-size on a monitor with a 100 dpi screen-resolution.
        Due to improved hardware (more internal storage, more RAM, improved
        scanners, and writeable CD-ROMs), we are now scanning at 600 dpi. These
        "raw scans" are stored on CD-ROM as LZW-compressed TIFFs, and we derive
        300 dpi LZW-compressed TIFFs for color correction. As part of the
        scanning process for each image, a project assistant completes a form
        known as an <B>Image Production</B> (IP) record. The IP records contain
        detailed technical data about the creation of the digital file for each
        image. These records are retained in hard copy at the project's office,
        and also become part of the <B>Image Information</B> record that is
        inserted into each image as metadata (see below).</P><P>The scanners and the monitors on the machines that support them are
        all calibrated on a regular basis; a project assistant uses a can of
        compressed air to blow dust, lint, and hair from the scanner bed and
        the transparency with every scan.</P><P><B>Color Correction:</B> The "raw" images generated by the scanning
        process are then individually color-corrected against the original
        transparency or slide (which has itself been color-corrected against
        the original artifact) by an editor. Between 1996 and 2001, we used
        Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and 5.0 and hooded Radius PressView 17SR and 21SR
        monitors, calibrated using ProSense 1.8 software. Since early 2002, we
        have been using LaCie Electron 19 and 22 Blue III monitors calibrated
        with the LaCie Blue Eye Sensor and software. The color-correction
        process, which takes upwards of thirty minutes -- and sometimes as long
        as several hours -- for each image is necessary in order to bring the
        color channels of the digital image into alignment with the hues and
        color tones of the original (see <A href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the
        William Blake Archive</A><!-- images 14-16 -->). This is a key step in
        establishing the scholarly integrity of the Archive because, although
        we cannot control the color settings on an individual user's monitor,
        the color-correction process ensures that each image will match the
        original artifact when displayed under optimal conditions (which we
        specify to users).</P><P><B>File Formats and Archival Storage:</B> All scanned images are
        saved using the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and archived as such on
        removable storage media -- first 8mm magnetic Exabyte tape and now
        CD-ROM (in Mac/ISO 9660 hybrid format). These raw images would provide
        the source for newly color-corrected images should that ever become
        desirable or necessary.</P><P>The color-corrected images displayed to users in the online Archive
        are all served using the JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group,
        ISO/IEC 10918) format. Users are presented with an in-line image at 100
        dpi and have the option to view an enlargement at 300 dpi for the study
        of details (see <A href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake
        Archive</A><!-- image 4 -->). The 100 dpi JPEG is derived from the
        color-corrected JPEG at 300 dpi using ImageMagick, X11 software that
        enables the batch processing of image files from the UNIX command
        line.</P><P><B>Metadata:</B> Each and every image in the Archive also contains
        textual metadata comprising its Image Information record. The Image
        Information record combines the technical data collected during the
        scanning process from the Image Production record with additional
        bibliographic documentation of the image, as well as information
        pertaining to provenance, present location, and the contact information
        for the owning institution. These textual records are, at the most
        literal level, a part of the Archive's image files. Image files are
        typically considered to be nothing but information about the images
        themselves (the composition of their pixilated bitmaps, essentially);
        but in practice, an image file can be the container for several
        different kinds of information. The Blake Archive takes advantage of
        this by slotting its Image Information records into that portion of the
        image file reserved for textual metadata. Because the textual content
        of the Image Information record now becomes a part of the image file
        itself in such an intimate way, this has the great advantage of
        allowing the record to travel with the image, even if it is downloaded
        and detached from the Archive's infrastructure. The Image Information
        record may be viewed using either the "Info" button located on the
        control panel of the Archive's ImageSizer applet (see below) or with
        the Text Display feature of standard software such as Adobe Photoshop
        or X-View.</P><H3 class="c3">Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</H3><P>All significant textual data in the Archive -- Blake's actual poetry
        and prose, as well as the editors' bibliographic commentary and
        illustration descriptions -- is encoded using the <B>Standard
        Generalized Markup Language</B> (SGML, ISO 8879). SGML is not a
        programming language; it is a descriptive meta-language used to encode
        (or "tag") textual data in such a way that it will remain usable even
        as platforms and file formats change over time. To take a very simple
        example, whereas the word processor used to write this document would
        represent <I>italics</I> by means of a proprietary binary code, SGML
        would indicate italics with a plain ASCII tag such as: &lt;hi
        rend="italic"&gt;this&lt;/hi&gt;. But SGML does not have to be merely
        descriptive; unlike HTML (which is in fact derived from SGML) SGML
        allows us to identify and encode the <I>structure</I> of documents. A
        title or heading (to once again take a very simple example) can be
        tagged and described as such rather than being simply rendered in a
        large font or in boldface, etc., as HTML would encourage. By explicitly
        describing textual data according to a recognized ISO standard, SGML
        frees the Archive from reliance on the vicissitudes of proprietary
        software packages.</P><P><B>Document Type Definitions:</B> A set of SGML tags designed for a
        specific purpose is known as a <B>Document Type Definition</B> (DTD). A
        DTD provides a hierarchical system of contexts and constraints which
        enables its tags to be used to create consistent document structures.
        The Blake Archive makes use of several DTDs developed specifically for
        the project at IATH. The primary and most expansive of these is known
        as the <B>Blake Archive Description</B> (BAD). The BAD DTD is used to
        encode all works at both the plate- and the copy-level (or more
        generically, at the object- and collection-level); its emphasis is on
        the description of Blake's works as physical artifacts. The BAD
        provides the basic document structure used by DynaWeb's stylesheets
        (see below) to deliver the Archive's content to users and also serves
        as the information-base consulted by the Archive's search engines (see
        below). The Archive's second DTD, the <B>Blake Object Description</B>
        (BOD) is used to encode the textual metadata that constitutes the Image
        Information record.</P><P>The TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) DTD is used for other materials
        in the archive, such as its bibliographies, collection lists and
        Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</I>, where
        description of the physical artifact is not the DTD's central
        purpose.</P><P><B>DynaWeb:</B> SGML-encoded files cannot be displayed by ordinary
        Web browsers. In order to take advantage of SGML's powerful
        document-structuring and information retrieval capabilities, while
        still allowing users seamless access to the Archive's content as an
        integral part of the World Wide Web, we use an advanced software
        package called <B>DynaWeb</B> (version 4.1), a product of Enigma
        Corporation (formerly Inso Corporation and Electronic Book
        Technologies). DynaWeb performs two key functions for the Archive:
        first, it allows us to program "stylesheets," which translate all of
        our SGML-encoded files into standard HTML. This translation happens "on
        the fly," meaning that there is no need for us to create and maintain
        separate HTML files to mirror the Archive's SGML-encoded materials.
        Rather, our SGML is rendered as HTML by the DynaWeb stylesheets
        whenever it is accessed by a user with a Web browser. It should also be
        noted here that the default stylesheets packaged with the DynaWeb
        software have been extensively customized by the technical staff at
        IATH in order to accommodate the Archive's unique visual orientation
        and user interface requirements (see <A href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the
        William Blake Archive</A><!-- image 3 -->).</P><P>The second key function DynaWeb performs is to support the search
        engine used for both our text searching and our image searching (see
        <A href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake Archive</A><!-- images 7-11 -->). In each case the DynaWeb software consults the
        Archive's accumulated SGML-encoded information-base to return matches
        ("hits") for a user's search query. The Institute's programmers have
        modified this behavior of the DynaWeb software to include a history of
        an individual user's searches, which can then be consulted by the user
        to aid in refining a sophisticated query.</P><H3 class="c3">Java</H3><P><A href="http://www.javasoft.com">Java</A> is a platform-independent
        programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in order to
        facilitate object-oriented programming in conjunction with the HTTP
        layer of the World Wide Web. This means that software written in Java
        can be "run" (activated) directly from ordinary Web pages, without
        requiring users to have pre-installed any of the software's files on
        their own personal machine and without regard for the type of computer
        or operating system used to access the Web page the Java software is
        invoked from (all of the major Web browsers are now Java-capable). The
        Blake Archive uses two separate Java applets (or applications), both
        developed at IATH in order to support the image-based editing that is
        fundamental to the project. Both of these applets, Inote and the
        ImageSizer, should be understood as computational implementations of
        the editorial practices governing the design of the Archive and its
        scholarly objectives. Both applets are based on version 1.1 of the Java
        Development Kit (JDK). As of November 1997, Java has been a candidate
        for adoption as an ISO standard.</P><P><B>Inote:</B> Inote is an image-annotation tool. It permits us to
        append textual notes ("annotations") to selected regions (or "details")
        of a particular image; these annotations are generated directly from
        the SGML-encoded illustration descriptions prepared by the editors.
        Inote functions most powerfully when used in conjunction with the
        Archive's image searching capabilities, where it can open an image
        found by the search engine, zoomed to the quadrant of the image
        containing the object(s) of the search query, with the relevant textual
        annotation displayed in a separate window (see <A href="../tour/index.html">A
        Tour of the William Blake Archive</A><!-- image 12 -->). From there,
        Inote allows the user to enlarge the image for further study and/or to
        access additional annotations located in other regions of the image.
        Inote may also be invoked directly from any of the Archive's Object
        View pages, allowing users to "browse" the annotations created for a
        given image (see <A href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake
        Archive</A><!-- image 13 -->).</P><P>In addition, users can download and install their own executable
        copies of Inote on their personal computers (using a version of the
        software programmed in the Java Runtime Environment); upon doing so,
        they may attach annotations of their own making to locally saved copies
        of an image, for use in either teaching or research. The most recent
        release of Inote is version 6.0.</P><P><B>ImageSizer:</B> The ImageSizer is a sophisticated image
        manipulation tool (see <A href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake
        Archive</A><!-- image 19 -->). Its principal function for the Archive
        is to allow users to view Blake's work on their computer screens at its
        actual physical dimensions. Users may invoke the ImageSizer's
        calibration applet to set a "cookie" informing the ImageSizer of their
        own unique screen-resolution. Based on this data (recorded in the
        cookie), all subsequently viewed images will be resized on the fly so
        as to appear at their true size on the user's screen. If a user returns
        to the Archive at some later date from the same machine, the data
        stored by the cookie will remain intact, and there will be no need to
        recalibrate. Users may also set the ImageSizer's calibration applet to
        deliver images sized at consistent proportions other than true size,
        for example, at twice normal size (for the study of details). In
        addition, the ImageSizer allows users to enlarge or reduce the image
        within its on-screen display area, and to view the textual metadata
        comprising the Image Information record embedded in each digital image
        file (see above).</P><H3 class="c3">Other</H3><P><B>Work in Progress Site:</B> The Archive maintains a
        password-protected Work in Progress (WIP) site for the exclusive use of
        the editors and the project staff. The WIP site provides gateways to
        private testing ports on our servers, which allow us to proof works in
        the Archive's online environment without their being publicly
        accessible to users before they've reached their finished state. The
        WIP site also houses a variety of "tracking sheets," enabling the
        editors and project staff to accurately monitor the different stages of
        preparation for the many hundreds of text and image files in the
        Archive, as well as a Reference area for other materials (such as an
        "X-Files" of unsolved problems, agendas for project meetings, copies of
        grant and development materials, a complete archive of postings from
        the blake-proj list, etc. -- see below).</P><P><B>E-mail:</B> The Blake Archive currently operates three electronic
        mailing lists. The oldest of these, an internal communications list
        known as "blake-proj," has existed since the project's inception and
        serves as the focal point for discussions among the editors, the
        project staff, and the technical staff at the Institute. All traffic on
        blake-proj is automatically archived using shareware software known as
        Hypermail (version 2b30). A second internal list, "blake-board", was
        created in fall of 1998 to facilitate communication between the editors
        and the Archive's <A href="../../../board.html">Advisory Board</A>.
        Finally, a public list, also created in 1998 and known as
        "blake-update" is used for distribution of periodic updates and
        announcements to our users. Any visitor to the Archive may subscribe to
        blake-update via a form on our front-end Web pages. All lists are run
        by the widely-used Majordomo software (version 1.94.5), and are based
        and maintained at IATH.</P><P><B>Access Tracking:</B> Access to all three of the Archive's servers
        (see above) is tracked using Wusage 7.0. This software provides daily
        records in both graphical and statistical form that allow us to observe
        the frequency with which texts and images are requested by users, as
        well as the type of browser and platform being used to access the
        Archive, the IP address of the users, and their domain name (allowing
        us to compare, say, access from educational sites with access from
        commercial sites).</P><P><B>Backup and Record Keeping</B>: All of the Archive's data is
        safeguarded via daily incremental backups on magnetic tape. In the
        event of a catastrophic disk failure or a server break-in, the
        Archive's data could be quickly restored from the off-site backup
        system.</P><P>The Archive's project office retains hard copies of all Image
        Production records, as well as ledgers tracking electronic file
        transfers, consignment of TIFF images to tape and CD-ROM, and shipping
        of transparencies and slides. Hard copies of the DTD and the Archive's
        SGML are also retained at the project office.</P><P>[See also "Managing the Blake Archive." <I>Romantic
