        paintings of William Blake (1757-1827) has increased to a degree that
        would have astonished his contemporaries. Now, more than a century
        since the "Blake revival" was inaugurated by a cadre of Victorian
        writers and artists, he is universally regarded as a seminal literary
        and visual artist. Today both his poetry and visual art in several
        media are admired by a global audience. He is one of the most
        anthologized and studied writers in English. "The Tyger" is the most
        anthologized poem in the language. Blake's poetry and prose have been
        translated into many languages, and the published scholarship is
        international. According to G. E. Bentley, Jr., there is Blake
        criticism in Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese),
        Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
        Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Latvian,
        Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Russian,
        Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh. <I>Blake Studies in
        Japan</I> (Bentley and Aoyama, 1994) alone contains nearly 1000
        entries.</P><P>Likewise, Blake is one of the most studied, exhibited, and collected
        of British artists: in April 1999, one copy of his illuminated <I>Book
        of Urizen</I> (24 plates) sold at auction for $2.5 million, widely
        noted to have been the most ever paid for a work of British
        "literature." In the last ten years alone large shows have been mounted
        in Australia, England, Germany, Israel, Japan, Scotland, Spain, and the
        United States, including major exhibitions in Melbourne (1989), Tokyo
        (1990), Barcelona (1996), Madrid (1996), and Melbourne (1999). Tate
        Britain's enormous 2000-01 exhibition moved to the Metropolitan Museum
        of New York in 2001, the Huntington Library and Art Gallery mounted an
        exhibition in 2003, and the Yale Center for British Art is planning an
        exhibition at the Institute of Art in Chicago for 2005.</P><P>"Blake"--in various configurations of his life, words, and
        images--has established and maintained a kind of multifaceted cultural
        currency that is exceedingly rare. His images are icons, endlessly
        reproduced wherever striking images are needed, and every year his
        words are incorporated into the latest books on the meaning of science,
        technology, history, and art. Jacob Epstein sculpted a bust of Blake,
        Francis Bacon painted his portrait. Blake's color print "Newton,"
        translated into a twelve-foot statue by Eduardo Paolozzi, greets all
        visitors to the new British Library. Notable composers, including
        Benjamin Britten, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Paul Hindemith, Gustav Holst,
        Virgil Thomson, and William Bolcom--have set his words to music
        hundreds if not thousands of times in the 20th century--more often than
        any British writer other than Shakespeare. There are significant Blake
        ballets (Ralph Vaughan Williams again), Blake operas (Britten's <I>The
        Little Sweep</I>), and Blake movies (Jim Jarmusch's <I>Dead Man</I>).
        Since it was set to music in 1902 by Hubert Parry, the prefatory poem
        to Blake's illuminated book <I>Milton</I>--"And did those feet in
        ancient time"--has evolved into an alternative national anthem. On the
        popular music scene Blake's influence has been profound for half a
        century; his words have been extensively recorded by major artists.</P><P>Blake's uses now extend to the students of the wide range of
        biblical and literary texts that he illustrated. Recent
        interdisciplinary approaches in literary studies, art history, and
        religious studies, especially, have encouraged students to understand
        illustrations as visual commentaries. Representative works include
        illustrations of the Book of Job and many other scenes from the Old and
        New Testaments, Dante's Divine Comedy, Virgil's Eclogues, Chaucer's
        <I>Canterbury Tales</I>, Spenser's <I>Fairie Queene</I>, Shakespeare's
        plays, Milton's <I>Paradise Lost</I>, <I>Nativity Ode</I>,
        <I>Comus</I>, <I>Paradise Regained</I>, <I>L'Allegro and Il
        Penseroso</I>, Thomas Gray's poems, and the powerful illustrations to
        John Stedman's <I>Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the
        Revolted Negroes of Surinam</I>.</P><P>In the broadest terms, the William Blake Archive, an archive of
        electronic editions available free as a site on the World Wide Web
        (http://www.blakearchive.org), is a contemporary response to the needs
        of this dispersed and various audience and to the reciprocal needs of
        the collections that currently hold Blake's original works. Both the
        audience and the collections on which the audience must rely share a
        strong interest in the accessibility and preservation of Blake's works.
        The Blake Archive attempts to serve both sets of needs at once by
        providing free access to its Web site, where Blake's works are
        accessible to a degree heretofore impossible. Whether our users'
        inquiries are inspired by a love of imaginative art and writing, term
        papers, or scholarly research, no other resource can match the depth or
        range of access provided by the archiving, searching, and viewing
        options at our Web site.</P><P>But we have designed the site primarily with scholars in mind. For
        them we believe that the Archive will soon become indispensable--as a
        handy reference, a point of departure, or a site of sustained research.
        The Archive has adhered to exceptionally high standards of site
        construction, digital reproduction, and electronic editing that are, we
        believe, models of their kind. They make it possible for the Archive to
        deliver <I>reproductions</I> that are more accurate in color, detail,
        and scale than the finest commercially published photomechanical
        reproductions and <I>texts</I> that are more faithful to Blake's own
        than any collected edition has provided. We have applied equally high
        standards in supplying a wealth of contextual information, which
        includes full and accurate bibliographical details and meticulous
        descriptions of the content of each image. Finally, users of the
        Archive can attain a new degree of access to these works through the
        combination of powerful text-searching and (for the first time in any
        medium) advanced image-searching tools that are made possible by the
        editors' detailed image descriptions and innovative software. Although
        we have designed the Archive to function properly within the limits of
        existing systems, we have built in considerable allowance for future
        improvements in hardware and software.</P><P>The Blake Archive first opened to the public in 1996 with simple
        reproductions from two of Blake's early "illuminated books" in
        "illuminated printing," as he labeled them. The reproductions were
        lightly encoded (in HTML only), accompanied by little contextual
        information, with no search capabilities. At this writing (January
        2004) the Archive contains fully searchable and scalable electronic
        editions of 50 copies of all of Blake's 19 illuminated books in the
        context of full, up-to-date bibliographic information about each image,
        carefully edited transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of
        all images, and extensive bibliographies. The Archive also incorporates
        a searchable electronic version of David V. Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry
        and Prose of William Blake</I>, the standard printed edition for
        reference.</P><P>Meanwhile, the roster of major contributors has grown from one to
        eighteen: the Library of Congress (now a sponsor) has been joined by
        the Huntington Library and Art Galleries; the Essick Collection; the
        New York Public Library; the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York; the
        Houghton Library and Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard; the Yale Center for
        British Art; the Glasgow University Library; the Fitzwilliam Museum,
        Cambridge; the British Museum; the National Gallery of Art, Washington;
        the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne; the Metropolitan Museum of
        New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Birmingham Art Museum;
        the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; and the Victoria and Albert
        Museum. Discussions are in progress with the only two major Blake
        collections not in the Archive. Our success to date in obtaining the
        confidence and good will of owners has reassured us that a rather vast
        undertaking such as ours is possible at the present time. As it is
        difficult to know how long present opportunities will last, we are
        pressing forward now. Further acknowledgement of the significance of
        the Blake Archive as a progressive scholarly and pedagogical enterprise
        has come from the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities
        at the University of Virginia, which first perceived the value of
        undertaking such a challenging project, and from the Getty Grant
        Program, which provided major funding for the first phase of design and
        construction, with additional grants from the Paul Mellon Centre for
        the Study of British Art (London), and the University of North
        Carolina, Chapel Hill. Hardware and software contributions have come
        from Sun Microsystems and Inso Corporation.</P><P><I>The scholarship</I>: The Archive had its origins in the fortunate
        confluence of four phenomena during one brief span of time in the early
        1990s: the completion of a broad base of mature Blake scholarship,
        capped by the publication of the first trustworthy map of the history
        of Blake's illuminated-book production; the appearance of a
        technological formation sufficiently revolutionary to alter some
        fundamental assumptions in scholarly editing; the emergence of sound
        new technical standards sufficiently robust to check, if not eliminate,
        the formidable threat of overnight obsolescence for large undertakings
        such as ours; and, finally, the creation of an organization
        specifically devoted to giving technological form to the ideas of
        humanists. Together these four events combined to provide the
        cornerstone of integrated archival, editorial, and educational
        initiatives that would have been impossible ten years, and probably too
        risky even five years, earlier.</P><P>Despite decades of scholarship, the knowledge of Blake's work was
        fragmentary and unsystematic until the final quarter of this century,
        partly because the upturn in his reputation came so long after his
        death but largely because the study of Blake has often split into
        distinct institutional compartments. Literary critics and art
        historians operate with different assumptions, values, aims, and
        procedures even when investigating the same original materials, as they
        were in this case. The resulting lack of coordination delayed the
        appearance of the standard tools of reference and reproduction that
        represent what we know about Blake, a printmaker and painter who was
        also an author.</P><P>But by the late 1980s the standard points of reference had at last
        fallen into place: reliable printed editions of the poetry, prose, and
        letters (Bentley 1978, Erdman 1982); excellent if rare and expensive
        facsimiles of one (but only one) of each of Blake's "illuminated books"
        (the Blake Trust-Trianon Press facsimiles, 1951-1976); documentary
        records of the life (Bentley 1969, 1988); and sound catalogues of the
        major categories of Blake's oeuvre, including the drawings and
        paintings (Butlin 1981), illuminated books and secondary criticism
        (Bentley 1977, 1995), complete graphic works (Bindman 1978), separate
        plates (Essick 1983), and commercial engravings (Essick 1991),
        augmented by numerous subsidiary catalogues that fill out the picture
        of Blake's multifaceted productive life. However, the crucial piece of
        this foundation that concerned Blake's illuminated books was weakened
        by errors that had generated a history of false inference and an
        essentially false overall picture. In 1993, building on the work of
        Robert Essick and G. E. Bentley, Jr. but reassessing the fundamental
        evidence, Joseph Viscomi's <I>Blake and the Idea of the Book</I> redrew
        the map of Blake's productions in his most famous and difficult medium.
        The stage was thereby set for a new phase of radical editorial
        revision--but revision of a kind that would be almost unimaginable in
        the medium of print.</P><P><I>The technology</I>: The technology that held the most promise in
        such a case was of course global network computing via the Internet and
        World Wide Web, which made it possible to conceive a long-distance
        professional collaboration and an "edition" of Blake that would
        transcend the limitations of conventional scholarly editing and in the
        process render irrelevant the gap between the original works in
        restricted collections, the incomplete sets of expensive facsimiles in
        the rare-book rooms of some large university libraries, and the
        indispensable but highly misleading printed editions on which "readers"
        had relied for their "Blake" since the Victorian Blake revival.</P><P><I>The encoding system</I>: But we were wary. Like everyone else in
        the humanities, we had seen grand scholarly hopes crucified on the
        cross of technological change and instant obsolescence. Not long before
        we began thinking seriously about the uses of digital technology, an
        unanticipated change in proprietary videodisc technology had pulled the
        rug out from under an ambitious scheme to reproduce a substantial
        selection of Blake's images at the University of Iowa. The PC-Mac wars
        were another reminder of the danger. But the promise of "platform
        independence" and portability represented by the codification of
        Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML, the source of the Web's
        HTML) and its scholarly counterpart in the coordinated standards of the
        Text Encoding Initiative (TEI, 1987-) finally made it plausible to
        devote years of work to an electronic scholarly resource in the
        humanities.</P><P><I>The institutional base</I>: But the promise of closing the
        editorial gap forced us, as humanists, to face the technological gap:
        we could half-envision electronic remedies that we could not execute.
        At that point, in 1993, we crossed paths with the then-new (and still
        unique) Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the
        University of Virginia (1992-). IATH's mission, we heard, was to help
        humanists use new information technology in carrying out their projects
        by supplying the requisite expertise and equipment at the
        research-and-development stage.</P><P>Our preliminary discussions with the staff of IATH introduced us to
        an exotic new world of markup codes, servers and clients, the Web, and
        Java. But the primary consequence was the conception of a William Blake
        Archive, which would be a comprehensive but coherent array of
        electronic scholarly editions to be made available free of charge on
        the Web. We came to believe that, given an elegant design and
        sufficiently powerful features--including an innovative way of
        searching for individual details in all the images in addition to the
        more conventional searches for specific texts--our project would help
        to set the pattern for serious art-historical and textual scholarship
        by electronic means at a key moment in their evolution. For a large
        international community of art historians and literary critics, among
        others, the Blake Archive would be a powerful reference tool, offering
        high-quality reproductions of an important body of work--much of it
        previously unreproduced, badly reproduced, or reproduced in rare
        volumes--and making that work accessible and useable in new ways that
        would improve interdisciplinary knowledge in areas where more and
        better knowledge was sorely needed.</P><P>Literary critics tend to favor the illuminated books in their
        research; art historians tend to favor paintings, prints, and drawings.
        While those disciplinary biases are of course natural and to some
        extent inevitable, the price of such specialized attention--in
        understanding the full artistic situation--has often been higher than
        it should be or needs to be. By incorporating as much of Blake's
        pictorial and literary canon as possible--with both images and texts
        organized, interlinked, and searchable in ways that only hypermedia
        systems will allow--the Archive would for the first time give scholars
        and students access to the major intersections between the illuminated
        books and Blake's other creative and commercial works. That is to say,
        by exploiting new information technology to deliver the historical,
        technical, and aesthetic contexts necessary to study Blake as
        printmaker, painter, and poet, the Archive would encourage a deeper,
        more responsible understanding of his aims and methods, which have been
        regularly misunderstood and misrepresented.</P><P>The concrete results would be</P><UL><LI>a large, searchable hypermedia archive on the World Wide Web</LI><LI>eventually, once the architecture of the Web-based archive was
          substantially complete and a broad representation of Blake's work was
          in place, a series of the works on portable media such as CD-ROM or
          DVD-ROM disks. Both products would be designed for use by a broad
          audience of scholars and students in their studies, classrooms, and
          museums. Portability makes disks a popular medium in classrooms and
          on desktop computers. But for scholars doing sustained original
          research, there is no adequate substitute for global access to a
          platform-independent William Blake Archive published on the Web.</LI></UL><BR/><BR/><P>Thus all along our fundamental aim has been to construct a unified
        international resource out of highly disparate and dispersed original
        materials to which access is ordinarily limited by institutional and
        other restrictions and by the sheer cost and difficulty of travel. As a
        public resource, the Blake Archive would be maintained free and open to
        all those who have access to the Web anywhere. We hoped we could
        persuade major collectors and collections of Blake material to agree to
        contribute their works to the Archive in precisely that public spirit,
        especially considering that very few works by Blake are on permanent
        exhibition due to concern about the effects of handling and excessive
        exposure to light. Several major institutional collections have now
        severely limited even scholars' access to the fragile originals. This
        includes at least two of our contributors, the Huntington and the
        Fitzwilliam. Even registered scholarly readers at the Huntington, for
        example, must get special permission from the Associate Curator of
        Early Printed Books to see a single illuminated book. Both institutions
        recently disbound and/or rebound several illuminated books in an
        attempt to improve preservation. Our contribution to these attempts at
        preservation is very direct: by making available searchable and
        sizeable images of the highest quality, we can provide access without
        compromising preservation in any way. Institutions that contribute to
        the Archive can continue to provide scholars and public full access to
        these treasures while at the same time taking all necessary measures to
        preserve the originals. (As a curator wrote to us: "I look forward to
        viewing [his institution's illuminated books]. You will probably know
        that we have now made a link from our web pages to the Blake Archive so
        that users can easily view our copies rather than over-tax the
        originals. With a fast-enough machine they come up almost
        instantaneously.")</P><P>Once archived digitally, structured and tagged (indexed for
        retrieval in SGML, adapted to the purpose), annotated with detailed
        descriptions, and orchestrated with a powerful search engine (in this
        case DynaWeb software), the images in the Archive could be examined
        like ordinary color reproductions. But they could also be searched
        alongside the texts, enlarged, computer enhanced, juxtaposed in
        numerous combinations, and otherwise manipulated to investigate
        features (such as the etched basis of the designs and texts) that have
        heretofore been imperceptible without close first-hand scrutiny of the
        dispersed original works. For example, the information necessary for
        doing good art history would enable scholars and students to draw sound
        conclusions about the differences between what Blake etched on his
        copper plates and what was added or changed afterwards in printing and
        coloring the impressions. But the published reproductions upon which
        much art-historical study necessarily depends simply cannot record such
        details with sufficient accuracy. Even scholars who are able to
        globetrot from collection to collection end up relying heavily upon
        their inadequate memories, notes, xeroxes, and photographs to
        compensate for the distances in time and space between collections.
        Seeing the originals is good in itself; but seeing them in fine,
        trustworthy reproductions, in context and in relation to one another is
        the scholarly ideal. Difficulty of access to originals and reliance on
        inadequate reproductions have handicapped and distorted even the best
        efforts. Again, the inevitable result has all too frequently been
        distortions of the record, misconstructions, and the waste of
        considerable scholarly labor.</P><P>We began by tackling the multitude of challenges presented by a
        single category of Blake's work, his "illuminated books." The
        illuminated books had their genesis in a series of graphic experiments
        that Blake began around 1788 and quickly evolved into a program of
        combining visual and textual elements in printed pages that he could
        control--design, write, etch, print, and color--himself. Though he
        produced a great deal of important work in other media, the illuminated
        books (c. 1788-1827) span most of his productive life and reflect its
        characteristic patterns. These much-discussed books are fundamental to
        his artistic reputation for several good reasons: they are spectacular
        examples of the illustrated book at one extreme of its development;
        fascinating explorations of the interactions between texts and designs
        at a level of narrative maturity seldom matched and never exceeded;
        major instances of the transformations of traditional iconography in
        the late eighteenth century; and central documents in British
        romanticism, both as historical period and as ideology.</P><P>In his lifetime, Blake produced about 175 copies of his 19
        illuminated books. About 20% of those--40 or so--have been reproduced,
        sometimes well, sometimes execrably, but in no coherent historical
        order. By the end of the first phase of our project, in June 2000, we
        had reproduced 41 copies, about half of which have never been
        reproduced before. This constituted, for the first time, an archive of
        reproductions suitable for serious research. Only in the past five
        years, largely as a result of Viscomi's extensive research, has the
        history of the production of the illuminated books been correctly
        understood. That in turn has made possible for the first time a sound
        scholarly archive, including numerous copies of the illuminated books
        that have been neglected because their place in the history of
        production was not understood.</P><P>Our next task was to add drawings, paintings, and several kinds of
        prints, manuscripts, and rare or unique typographical works to the
        Archive. Doing so is yielding an augmented "Blake" considerably larger
        than the one most familiar to students and scholars, especially those
        who approach Blake from the literary side. Without sacrificing the
        Blake of <I>The Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I> and <I>The
        Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I>, the extended archive has already begun
        to reveal the painter-printmaker whose illuminated books emerged from
        the materials, work routines, and imagery of eighteenth-century history
        painting, watercolor drawing, and graphic arts, as well as from the
        <I>literary</I> routines of Milton, the Bible, Swedenborg, and Boehme,
        which students of Blake have more often investigated. Commercial
        illustrations, for example, can bring into focus a major convergence
        between Blake's illuminated book <I>Visions of the Daughters of
        Albion</I> (1793) and his engravings to J. G. Stedman's <I>Narrative,
        of a Five Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of
        Surinam</I> (etched 1791). Even the familiar profile of a poet-Blake is
        deepened by the inclusion of Blake's extensive group of literary
        illustrations, such as those to Milton's poems, which should be seen in
        connection with Blake's 50-plate illuminated book <I>Milton</I>.</P><P>We are hoping, of course, that the Archive, once extended to
        encompass the full range of Blake's work, including his many
        illustrations of the work of other writers, will ultimately set a new
        standard of accessibility to a vast collection of visual and textual
        materials that are central to an adequate grasp of the art and
        literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But we have also
        come to see the Blake project as a pacesetting instance of a
        fundamental shift in the ideas of "archive," "catalogue," and "edition"
        as both processes and products. Though "edition" and "archive" are the
        terms we have fallen back on, in fact we have envisioned a unique
        resource unlike any other currently available--a hybrid all-in-one
        edition, catalogue, database, and set of scholarly tools capable of
        taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by new information
        technology.</P><P><I>The Uses of the Blake Archive as a Prototype</I>: The Blake
        Archive is not designed to be an isolated resource. We foresee a time
        when it will be only one of very many cooperating electronic resources
        for scholarly research. But until the standards for such resources
        evolve, projects like ours must be in the business of setting standards
        by designing prototype tools and techniques. A guiding aim of our
        project is to solve problems with methods that are widely applicable.
        The collaborative procedures we have begun to develop, which we hope
        will become useful prototypes of "distance editing," depend upon the
        intensive day-to-day teamwork among the three editors and the staff of
        IATH to integrate the textual, art-historical, critical, and technical
        expertise necessary for the construction of a scholarly resource as
        complex as this one.</P><P>We see the products of our collaboration as similarly prototypical:
        in facing new technical and editorial challenges, the Blake project
        will leave future archivists, editors, and cataloguers the benefits of
        new tools. The Document Type Definition (DTD) developed by the Text
        Encoding Initiative (TEI) has become the default standard for encoded
        electronic texts. We believe that the Blake Archive DTD has the
        potential to become the standard for encoded electronic <I>images</I>
        that the TEI is for encoded electronic texts. In this image-oriented
        non-TEI DTD--an art historian's DTD if you will--we are constructing
        the most comprehensive <I>applied</I> product of its kind, one robust
        and flexible enough to be readily adapted to the needs of many other
        projects that use images extensively. In addition, software developed
        by IATH, such as our Java applets Inote and ImageSizer, will be
        adaptable to virtually any project in which images are important.</P><P>The perception that our editorial and technical experience is
        directly relevant to other projects has generated steadily increasing
        interest in the Archive that has nothing to do with Blake per se.
        Hence, for example, we have been invited to speak at numerous meetings
        where the subject was not Blake but humanities computing or editorial
        theory.</P><P>Because the signal advantage of electronic editing and cataloguing
        is the open-endedness that makes it possible to add materials, correct
        errors, incorporate new discoveries, and construct new relationships,
        we have believed from the first that our principal objective-- the most
        significant contribution we can hope to make--should be the creation of
        a sound and durable foundation for decades of future scholarship. Since
        1995, when the Getty Grant Program underwrote the initial phase of our
        project, we have worked to shape the foundations of the Archive in
        strict accordance with our original ideals and priorities.</P><HR class="c2" width="70%" noshade="noshade"/><P class="c3"><A href="#top">Top</A> | <A href="#significance">Significance</A> | <A href="#history">History</A> |

        volumes in a new series published by the Blake Trust, Tate Gallery, and
        Princeton University Press (see <A href="../principles/index.html">Editorial
        Principles</A>), we came face to face with the limitations of even
        lavishly illustrated books for the kind of Blake edition we had
        envisioned and began to conceive the outlines of an electronic edition
        that might overcome many of these limitations.</P><P>With this in mind, at the urging of Jerome McGann we visited IATH in
        the summer of 1993 to see his Rossetti project (see "The Rossetti
        Archive and Image-Based Electronic Editing," 1996, "<A href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/public/jjm2f/rationale.html">The
        Rationale of Hypertext</A>," 1997, and "<A href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/~jjm2f/chum.html">Imagining What You
        Don't Know: The Theoretical Goals of the Rossetti Archive</A>," 1998)
        and to meet with the staff of the Institute, including John Unsworth,
        the new director. After extensive discussions and demonstrations, we
        concluded not only that our concept of a rather primitive electronic
        edition was technically feasible but also that a scholarly resource far
        more ambitiously transformative was within the realm of
        possibility.</P><P>In 1994 we applied to become Associate Networked Fellows of IATH and
        drew up a preliminary proposal for a Blake "archive"--appropriating
        McGann's term for our somewhat different purposes--in three major
        phases that would tackle first the difficulties presented by the
        illuminated books, second the remaining categories of work in Blake's
        oeuvre (prints, paintings, drawings, texts), and third such issues as
        secondary publication (on disks), interpretive supplementary material,
        and educational applications. A great deal of further planning over the
        course of the year developed this initial proposal into the original
        blueprint for the Archive.</P><P><B>Blake Archive, Phase One, 1995-2000.</B> In 1995, we received a
        grant from the Getty Grant Program to underwrite the initial three
        years of planning and execution focused on the illuminated books. The
        Blake project was the first opportunity for IATH to work intensively
        with researchers from outside the University of Virginia community. The
        Institute provided the team with full-scale technical assistance and
        archive-design consultation, along with the necessary equipment to
        establish the foundations of the Archive.</P><P><B>Year 1, 1995-96:</B> The Institute phase of the project began
        with Joseph Viscomi as a resident fellow for the year. With our first
        project manager, Amy Sexton, and a student technical assistant in
        place, the three editors met with IATH staff in the summer of 1995--in
        retrospect, the first "Blake camp," as we came to call these annual
        planning and problem-solving sessions. We drew up a two-phase plan with
        illuminated books in the first phase and non-illuminated works in the
        second. At the end of the second phase the architecture of the Blake
        Archive would be complete and all its wings would have substantial
        content.</P><P>We settled easily into our division of labor as an outgrowth of the
        editors' experience with the Blake Trust volumes. We would make all
        final decisions collectively. We would deal with institutions according
        to our individual experience with them. Beyond that, Eaves and Essick
        would share major responsibility for generating the bibliographical
        information and image descriptions. Viscomi would take major
        responsibility for generating digital images and transcriptions of
        Blake's texts. Among other duties--parsing the SGML markup, moving
        works from testing to publication, etc.--the project manager would
        coordinate activities at IATH, including our project's access to the
        technical staff. Everyone would proofread and test.</P><P>We compiled a prioritized list of illuminated books (for our
        principles of selection, see <A href="../principles/index.html">Editorial
        Principles</A>) and began to seek cooperation from key collections of
        Blake material. After reading and consultation that included sessions
        with a member of the Getty/MESL (Museum Educational Site Licensing)
        project in digital imaging, we conducted extensive trials to determine
        the optimum balance of photographic format, scanning resolution, and
        file size for an archive of this type. Key benchmarks were arrived at
        (see <A href="../principles/index.html">Editorial
        Principles</A>), and enough fundamental design work was completed to
        move us to the next stage. We established <I>blake-proj</I>, the online
        discussion group that has proven essential to the collaboration that
        has been a hallmark of the Archive's development (see Morris Eaves,
        "Collaboration Takes More Than E-Mail: Behind the Scenes at the Blake
        Archive". <I>Journal of Electronic Publishing</I> 3.2 [Dec. 1997]:
        <A href="http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/03-02/blake.html">http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/03-02/blake.html</A>).</P><P>By the end of the inaugural year we had concluded agreements with
        four contributors that control access to thousands of Blake's images,
        the Library of Congress (which became our official co-sponsor), the
        Huntington Library and Art Galleries, Glasgow University Library in
        Scotland, and the Essick Collection, the largest collection of Blake
        and his followers in private hands. The editors personally supervised a
        six-day photographic session at the Library of Congress that yielded
        620 images. All the new photography was in our benchmark format, 4x5
        color transparencies with color bars and gray scales.</P><P>During the year we made our first public outings. We presented our
        plans at the Society for Textual Studies meeting in New York and did
        our first demonstration (using mockups) at the meeting of the Society
        for Documentary Editing in Baltimore. Finally, we opened a Web version
        of the Blake Archive to the public with two copies each of Blake's
        <I>Book of Thel</I> and <I>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</I>,
        using the first version of our page design, lightly coded in HTML only,
        with no search capabilities or Java applets.</P><P><B>Year 2, 1996-97:</B> In retrospect this was a make-or-break year.
        At the second summer Blake camp we discussed our goals: to pursue
        negotiations with additional major collections; to complete the first
        version of the Blake Archive DTD--the Document Type Definition (DTD)
        for the SGML-encoded illuminated books; to add search capabilities for
        images as well as for texts; and to ready for testing a single work for
        publication in something approaching a fully operative form. New
        hardware (a server), software (DynaWeb, our search engine), and
        technical support were donated by Sun Microsystems and Inso
        Corporation.</P><P>A major initial challenge was to find a system to base our image
        searches on. We began by giving careful consideration to two leading
        candidates. <I>"Machine vision" or "pattern-recognition" searches</I>
        attempt to identify objects in digitized images by recognizing patterns
        (wheat vs. waves). <I>Controlled-vocabulary searches</I> operate by
        assigning words to pictures (sheep, Urizen, finger, contrapposto). The
        most formidable iconographic classification system is Iconclass,
        developed by a Leiden art historian, Henri van der Waal, and published
        after his death in 17 volumes, 1973-1985.</P><P>Machine vision is a fascinating research subject in computer labs
        but, we quickly discovered, completely incapable of making the precise
        discriminations we had in mind. Iconclass is more capable--with the
        advantage of being a published point of reference. But its
        disadvantages are major. It is little known among art historians, and
        its status and stature even in the image-resource community (of
        librarians and curators) are insecure. People who mention it seldom, if
        pressed, seem to understand it. Users complain that the codes are hard
        to remember--they have to be tracked down laboriously in the printed
        volumes or in the electronic browser--and that new codes are too
        difficult to add, making the system less flexible than it needs to be.
        Very few projects use it intensively--and none as intensively as we
        would be using it. Some collections (of slides or art objects) use
        Iconclass codes--usually only a few--to classify the pictures in their
        collections, but such classifications are very different from our
        intricate descriptions of individual images and their numerous
        components. Despite the aspiration of Iconclass to become a universal
        system of image description, its origins are still evident in its
        disproportionate emphasis upon a highly conventional Renaissance
        iconography.</P><P>Blake's works are full of unconventional elements. His uniqueness
        and the specificity of Blake studies require a more detailed and
        precise semantics, we concluded, than a general system like Iconclass
        provides. Thus we set out to develop our own controlled vocabulary of
        descriptive terms empirically, in the course of describing the images
        for the first time--a procedure we have followed throughout the project
        with excellent results, we believe. We remain interested in and open to
        those original alternatives, however. We plan to look into the
        possibility of integrating Iconclass codes with Archive codes once our
        vocabulary is set; and we recently reviewed pattern-recognition
        searching with a Kodak engineer, who suggested that it could be useful
        in searching for colors, textures, and techniques. We intend to remain
        in the vanguard of efforts to create working solutions to these
        problems. (<!--<a href="http://132.229.191.98:1080/hypereind/">-->The
        HyperIconics Project lists the Blake Archive as one of its "exemplary
        sites"--a special tribute, we feel, considering that the project
        backers, at the University of Leiden, are among the heirs of the
        Iconclass legacy.)</P><P>We decided to incorporate two significant reference works: an
        extensive bibliography of works useful in the study of Blake and David
        V. Erdman's standard printed edition, <I>The Complete Poetry and Prose
        of William Blake</I> (complete with Erdman's textual notes). We
        published the first bibliography in 1997. The Erdman edition presented
        more formidable challenges, including a separate TEI-compliant DTD. The
        first round of encoding was completed in 1997, but, in order to create
        a searchable text, integrated with the rest of the Archive, a good deal
        of further work was required. (We tested two early versions and
        published in late 1999.)</P><P>A sophisticated final design for the site, complete with search
        engine and a Java applet, Inote, was refined over several months of
        discussion, experiment, testing, and revision. Inote, a tool designed
        at IATH for image viewing and annotation, was integrated with the
        search engine to zoom in automatically on particular visual details and
        display the editor's descriptions in image searches. We decided that
        users must also have a way of controlling the size of images. The
        result was ImageSizer, a second Java applet, which allows a user to
        view images at their original size or to enlarge and reduce them at
        will.</P><P>Meanwhile, the three editors at their separate outposts and the
        project manager and technical assistant at IATH proceeded according to
        the division of labor that had been worked out the previous year.
        Digital scanning, painstaking image-by-image color correction on
        special professional equipment, and elaborate SGML markup of all images
        began in earnest. As always, the Archive discussion group blake-proj
        remained the place where all momentous and trivial issues were hashed
        out. In addition, we created a work-in-progress Web site (our WIP
        site), accessible by password, where we could conduct all our
        pre-publication testing.</P><P>During the year we made public presentations of the Archive in New
        York, Washington DC, New Haven, Cambridge (UK), and Oxford (UK). We
        also reached final agreements with two new contributors, the New York
        Public Library and the Yale Center for British Art, and continued the
        process of acquiring and scanning 4x5 transparencies as we approached
        other major repositories.</P><P><B>Years 3-4, 1997-99:</B> Whatever remained unresolved in our usual
        forums--the test site and blake-proj--was moved onto the agenda of our
        third Blake camp, where we were able to get to the bottom of thorny
        problems--the logic of searches, the operation of Inote, the
        consistency of displays, the structure of the SGML hierarchy, editorial
        formats--that were blocking the first publication of a fully searchable
        and resizable work in the Archive. After two months of intensive
        tweaking and testing, we added a detailed Help document and opened the
        new site to the public in August 1997 with a single work, <I>The Book
        of Thel</I> copy F from the Library of Congress--a mere eight plates
        but, as far as we were concerned, a landmark.</P><P>We determined that 1997-1999 were to be years of production and
        publication that would move us toward the primary goal we specified in
        the original plan: to publish at least one copy of each of Blake's 19
        illuminated books, along with multiple copies of several books. As of
        June 1998, 23 copies of 13 books had been published; as of June 1999,
        33 copies of 18 books had been published. (For information on the
        significance of individual copies, see <A href="../../all-updates.html">Blake Archive
        Updates</A>).</P><P>In early 1999 we also added a new wing to the site. "About the
        Archive" makes available a large body of documentation and
        supplementary material: The Archive at a Glance (for a quick overview),
        Editorial Principles and Methodology, a Technical Summary, a detailed
        Plan of the Archive, Frequently Asked Questions, and a list of
        published scholarship about the Archive along with published reviews of
        the project. In June 1999 we added a long-anticipated Tour of the
        Archive. Through a sequence of several dozen graphical screenshots
        linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduces users to the basic
        organization and structure of the Archive, the features of its
        interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and
        ImageSizer applications. During these years we reached agreements with
        the Pierpont Morgan Library (New York), the Houghton Library (Harvard
        University), and the Fitzwilliam Museum (Cambridge University). We were
        well along in the process of acquiring the necessary photographs from
        these collections, some by generous loans of file transparencies,
        others by new photography: at the Morgan Library, for instance, the
        editors supervised a three-day photographic session that produced 255
        images. In 1997-98 the Archive received a modest grant from the Paul
        Mellon Centre for the Study of British Art (London), the first, if we
        are not mistaken, ever given by the Mellon Centre in support of an
        electronic project. We gave public presentations of the project on
        several occasions; a well-attended session on Romanticism at the annual
        MLA meeting (San Francisco, Dec. 1998) eventuated in the publication of
        five papers on the Archive (<I>The Wordsworth Circle</I>, 1999, see
        Articles about the Archive <A href="../articles/index.html">Articles
        about the Archive</A>).</P><P><B>Year 5, 1999-2000:</B> We spent the year consolidating our gains
        and preparing to initiate, in 2000-2003, a second phase of
        development.</P><P>Matthew Kirschenbaum, who had served as our Project Manager while a
        graduate student at the University of Virginia, became our Technical
        Editor when he moved to his new faculty position in humanities research
        computing at the University of Kentucky (since 2001, at the University
        of Maryland). Kirschenbaum's appointment, one of the first of its kind
        in the nation, allowed him to continue overseeing the technical
        development of the project in collaboration with IATH, while also
        working to refine some of its potential contributions to humanities
        computing and digital libraries, such as the Archive's prototypes for
        searching and manipulating structured image-based data and the
        expansion of the Archive's DTD into a more generalized resource usable
        by other projects.</P><P>After final testing, we published our TEI-compliant, searchable
        electronic version of David Erdman's edition of Blake's <I>Complete
        Poetry and Prose</I>, which had been in production for more than three
        years.</P><P>We continued publishing additional copies of illuminated books in
        order to clear our second hurdle: after publishing one copy of every
        illuminated book, to publish at least one copy of every printing of
        every book, according to the historical rationale that sets our
        priorities (see <A href="../principles/index.html">Editorial
        Principles</A>). We also added multiple copies of works from several
        printings--mostly copies that have seldom or never been reproduced or
        reproduced badly--and began to create the structure that would
        eventually allow us to incorporate related materials that help to
        document the history of production in context (individual proofs, early
        states, sketches, associated drawings, prints, and paintings).</P><P>The last illuminated book to be represented in the Archive, Blake's
        100-plate <I>Jerusalem</I> (copy E, the only complete colored copy,
        from the Yale Center for British Art), continued to serve, while in
        development for several years, as an object of editorial inquiry that
        led gradually to major changes in our protocols.</P><P>Our newly convened advisory board--a broad group of museum curators,
        art historians, textual critics, romanticists, authorities in
        humanities computing, and Blake scholars--agreed to participate in the
        testing of new works at our work-in-progress site. To facilitate
        communication, we set up a new online discussion group for them.</P><P>Meanwhile, we reviewed our procedures for reproducing images in
        discussions with experts in image compression at the University of
        Rochester, Kodak, and Xerox, including members of the international
        team that is creating JPEG 2000, a new version of the JPEG standard by
        which the images on our site are generated. (See <A href="../tech/index.html">Technical
        Summary</A>).</P><P>Finally, of course, we continued to acquire additional works from
        our contributing institutions and to establish cooperation with others.
        But we already had access to more than enough material to represent
        very amply the artistic range of Blake and his contemporaries. We also
        presented our project in a variety of public forums, including Dublin
        (Ireland), Charlottesville (VA), and Halifax, Nova Scotia.</P><P><B>Blake Archive, Phase Two, 2000-2003.</B> As our initial 3-year
        funding from the Getty Grant Program allowed us to initiate the first
        (5-year) phase of our work, an NEH/Preservation and Access grant
        allowed us to initiate a new phase of development with three principal
        aims: to continue adding illuminated books to the Archive; to extend
        the image-oriented Blake Archive DTD and stylesheets to accommodate the
        other categories of Blake's works; and to incorporate a significant
        representation of work from these categories into the new wings of the
        Archive, including a Preview wing--a provisional area that would allow
        a more expeditious movement of works from the editorial pipeline into
        the Archive proper. In the process, we aimed to greatly increase the
        size of the Archive and make it fully representative of the range of
        Blake's work. As we extend the reach of the Archive to accommodate such
        works, we shall also begin to build a statistical database of
        information about the uses of the Archive and develop a method of
        assessing users' responses.</P><P>We began by assessing the requirements, scholarly and technical, of
        each category of work required to complete the structure of the
        Archive: prints (original and reproductive), paintings, drawings,
        manuscripts, and typographical works. From that assessment flowed the
        design for the ultimate SGML architecture. Although we started with the
        illuminated books because they required us to address the problems of
        both texts and pictures (discrete, juxtaposed, and fused), the other
        categories of Blake's oeuvre are distinct in important respects. For
        instance, the illuminated books are book-like in scale; none is as
        small as Blake's smallest works or as large as his largest paintings.
        The issue of scale--to take only that one--raises art-historical
        questions (should we continue to privilege the actual size of the
        images?) and technical questions (should we limit the use of ImageSizer
        or extend its capabilities?) that we must deal with. The task at hand
        has been to anticipate changes in the DTD and stylesheets, interface,
        image descriptions, art-historical and textual information, and arrive
        at an initial set of blueprints that allowed us to add new
        subcategories of Blake's work to the Archive.</P><P>Along with the redesign and extension of the DTD come problems of
        rendering and description--how to render images across various new
        categories in ways that will be coherent with the rest of the Archive
        and yet remain faithful to the images themselves. Blake's work beyond
        the illuminated-book canon includes the drawings, paintings, and prints
        to which the artist devoted most of his productive life, along with
        important typographical works and manuscripts. Although the Archive has
        been designed with the aim of accommodating all of Blake's work (and,
        for that matter, the work of his contemporaries as well), these
        additional categories will require special attention at each stage:
        scanning and correcting line engravings, for instance, present new
        technical problems, such as a tendency toward optical distortion in
        areas of close crosshatching, that we shall have to solve; single
        "paintings," separate "plates," and continuous "pages" of type involve
        us in structural relations distinct from those characteristic of the
        illuminated books. Similarly, we have been working out protocols for
        describing images that are in many respects unlike the images of the
        illuminated books for which our present controlled vocabulary has been
        developed.</P><P>We began the shift from illuminated works to the other categories
        with two large and significant bodies of material: Blake's
        illustrations of the Book of Job and of John Milton's poems, in several
        different media (almost 200 items). (Users regularly write us asking
        for Blake's designs to Job, Dante, and Milton.) These images, which are
        often historically, thematically, and formally related to the
        illuminated books, meet two criteria of "significance": they are
        representative of Blake's oeuvre as a whole, and they are among the
        works most often studied by Blake scholars. Hence they constitute a
        logical, large, but manageable first extension of what we have already
        done. The Huntington, one of our contributors, holds the world's
        largest collection of Blake's illustrations to the works of Milton. In
        addition, we shall include all of Blake's illustrations to Edward
        Young's <I>Night Thoughts</I> (537), Thomas Gray's Poems (117), and
        Dante's <I>Divine Comedy</I> (101).</P><P>From these clusters we shall move to others, generally guided by the
        following priorities: original works in coherent series that are
        closely related to the illuminated books already present in the
        Archive, individual items closely related to those works in turn, works
        in significant subcategories where we can provide a large and
        representative sample, the commercial prints (separate and in series,
        first those designed and engraved by Blake, then those designed by
        Blake, followed finally by those engraved by Blake), manuscripts (such
        as letters), and typographical works. (See <A href="#presentandfuture">Present and Future</A>.)</P><P>This approach--expanding coherently from the core outward--has
        dominated the first phase of our development and has continued to
        dominate the second, as it must if we are to maximize the usefulness of
        the Archive to students and scholars. We stress, however, that this
        pattern of growth, useful as it is, has not been adopted out of any
        sense that the illuminated books we started with are primary and the
        remaining work secondary. Far from it: one of our major goals is to
        contribute to a reassessment of such conventional assumptions. In the
        past, what has <I>counted</I> as primary or secondary among art
        historians and literary critics has depended far too heavily on the
        very restrictions (of access, of disciplinary perspective) that we want
        to relax if not eliminate in the name of a fuller understanding. The
        new means of access we have provided, such as powerful image-searching
        capabilities, are most valuable to users when searches are conducted
        across related bodies of material. In emphasizing that kind of breadth,
        we are not ignoring the competing criterion of representativeness--and
        the tension between depth and breadth can be productive. We believe
        that our approach stands the best chance of serving both needs at once.
        That is, the Archive will steadily become more representative as it
        becomes more extensive but at the least possible sacrifice of
        utilitarian coherence. We are always aware of the dangers of mere
        sampling, however extensive, perhaps because the World Wide Web itself
        offers so many terrifying object lessons.</P><P>By the end of 2003, the Archive contained approximately 4200 images,
        including at least one copy of every illuminated book and in many cases
        multiple copies, as well as a large number of Blake's paintings,
        drawings, engravings, manuscripts, and typographical works. A
        significant proportion of these will be fully tested and publicly
        available. Phase two will continue well beyond these three years,
        certainly. But three labor-intensive years of final design work,
        scanning, encoding, and acquisition of new materials will have helped
        to ensure the success of the Archive as originally conceived.</P><HR class="c2" width="70%" noshade="noshade"/><P class="c3"><A href="#top">Top</A> | <A href="#significance">Significance</A> | <A href="#history">History</A> |

        Future</A></H3><P>We continue to depend upon the system of close collaboration we have
        developed during the past several years: collectively, the editors make
        final decisions about the form and content of the Archive and control
        the workflow. At the University of North Carolina, Viscomi takes major
        responsibility for acquiring, scanning, and color-correcting new images
        on professional equipment designed for the purpose. Until 2002, Viscomi
        also transcribed and edited most of the texts in the Archive. These
        duties are now performed by Eaves, at the University of Rochester, and
        Essick, at the University of California, Riverside, who also produce
        SGML-encoded descriptions of images and bibliographical information at
        various levels (plate or object level, copy level, series or work
        level, and so on). Day-to-day progress is coordinated by our project
        manager, currently Justin Van Kleeck. For testing, all the editors
        collaborate with all IATH staff members--who are joined by members of
        the advisory board.</P><P>Since editorial decisions always have technical implications, they
        must be arrived at in consultation with the expert staff at IATH and
        our Technical Editor Andrea Laue (University of Virginia). The editors
        participate actively in discussing all details of execution within
        their technical reach and test the practical outcome on the Archive's
        work-in-progress site. Most of those ongoing conversations are
        conducted daily (and vigorously, sometimes for weeks at a time) on the
        project's electronic forum, blake-proj, supplemented of course by
        telephone, the annual Blake camps (see above, History), and meetings in
        person as needed. Any student assistants collaborate closely with the
        editors who oversee their work. The proof that this arrangement has
        worked well in moving the project along swiftly and efficiently is
        manifest, we believe, in the record of productivity to date. As we add
        new categories of Blake's work to the Archive, we shall continue to
        require significant technical support from IATH, whose configuration of
        expertise, like its mission in the humanities, is unique.</P><P>The Archive's first phase was defined by three goals: to design and
        construct the foundations of a searchable, SGML-encoded Archive; to
        acquire major works, mostly illuminated books, from major collections
        required for the basic structure of the Archive; and to place in the
        Archive, fully marked up and publicly accessible free on the Web, at
        least one copy of each illuminated book. We achieved the last of these
        goals in 2003 with the publication of <I>Jerusalem</I>. We are now very
        far along toward the subsequent goal of placing multiple copies of
        illuminated books in the Archive whenever possible, with the focus on
        those copies that represent different <I>printings</I> of each book.
        But since books printed in the same session can differ
        significantly--with important variants in coloring, motifs,
        arrangements, etc.--we are including multiple copies of books from the
        same printing as well as those from different printings. The public's
        exposure to Blake--and this includes many advanced students and not a
        few scholars--has been narrowly restricted to a small number of items
        that have been too frequently reproduced, such as <I>Songs of
        Innocence</I> copy B. We shall continue to acquire and incorporate
        copies never before reproduced or poorly reproduced--a category that
        unfortunately includes all but a very few of the books--thereby making
        rare and unique material widely accessible, in many cases for the first
        time.</P><P>But the preoccupations of our day-to-day work have shifted to works
        in other categories--prints of various kinds, drawings, paintings,
        manuscripts, and typographical works. We began phase two with a large
        number of transparencies from these categories--about 750 ready to be
        digitized, corrected, marked up, and placed in the Archive at an
        appropriate time. To this number, we have in the past three years added
        over 2000 transparencies and digital images from nine collections,
        including 1263 from the British Museum (the world's largest Blake
        collection), and the entire Blake collections of the Fogg Museum of
        Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery, Washington,
        the National Gallery of Victoria, the Metropolitan Museum, the
        Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and
        the Whitworth Art Museum, Manchester--far more than we initially
        anticipated.</P><P>The process of acquiring and editing the non-illuminated works has
        been generally guided by these priorities:</P><P><B>I.a:</B> Large clusters of significant works, such as Blake's Job
        and Milton illustrations, that are most closely related to the
        illuminated books and to one another. This step maintains the core
        coherence in the Archive as it grows and at the same time provides
        scholars and students with the range of materials they have found most
        valuable for study.</P><P><B>I.b:</B> Individual works that are also related to the
        illuminated books, such as proofs, separate colored impressions,
        commercial engravings, etc.</P><P><B>II.a:</B> Works in subcategories of which we can provide a large
        and representative sample, such as the famous group of twelve large
        "color prints" of 1795.</P><P><B>II.b:</B> The entire group of original and reproductive prints,
        first those both designed and engraved by Blake (such as the engravings
        for Young's poem <I>Night Thoughts</I>), followed first by those
        designed by Blake and engraved by others (such as the illustrations to
        Blair's poem The Grave), and finally by those engraved by Blake after
        other artists.</P><P><B>III:</B> Manuscripts and typographic works, all either unique or
        very rare.</P><P>On the public side, our main accomplishment of the second phase has
        been the publication of our first two "non-illuminated" works including
        <I>The Book of Job</I> watercolors (Butts copy), watercolors and
        manuscripts associated with Blake's illustrations to Milton's
        <I>L'Allegro</I> and <I>Il Penseroso</I>, and illustrations designed by
        Blake to Robert Blair's <I>The Grave</I>. These were published in our
        new Preview mode, devised in the interest of publishing the greatest
        number of high-quality images in the shortest span of time. Like all
        other items in the Archive, works in Preview are in full and accurate
        color, with enlargements, and with searchable transcriptions of any
        texts, including even the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions
        unavailable in Preview are image search and Inote.</P><P>Non-illuminated materials present several editorial challenges-from
        convoluted transcriptions featuring multiple foreign character sets to
        large images requiring adjustments to our scaling equations-and several
        technical challenges: publication of non-illuminated materials required
        an entirely new "wing" of the Archive. Technical development began in
        late summer 2001 and was completed in early winter 2002 with the
        publication of the Job watercolors in February 2002. Work completed
        during that time laid a foundation for the publication of a broad range
        of non-illuminated materials, including a set of Blake's engravings,
        <I>Illustrations of the Book of Job</I>, published in December
        2002.</P><P>Along with the wing of non-illuminated works, we also added a
        biography, glossary, and chronology in the "About Blake" wing. The
        biography offers extensive background on Blake's life and works, and
        even on his acquaintances, all with over 100 accompanying illustrations
        ranging from works by Blake and others to pictures of Blake's printing
        methods. The glossary treats terms, names, and concepts in Blake that
        can be dizzying for his audience. The chronology covers important dates
        in Blake's life, including publications and places of residence. The
        biography and glossary are both encoded in XML.</P><P>During this same period we have continued to add illuminated works
        to the Archive. We now have 50 copies of all of Blake's 19 illuminated
        works. In addition to <I>America</I> copy O and <I>Europe</I> copy K,
        which we published in March 2001, we have published the following
        illuminated works: <I>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I> copy G,
        <I>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</I> copy P, and <I>The Book of
        Urizen</I> copies A, C and F, and <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E. (Explanatory
        updates for all publications are available; see <A href="../../all-updates.html">Blake Archive
        Updates</A>.)</P><P>Since its inception, evidence of the use of the Archive "to sustain
        serious scholarship"--our stated objective--has continued to
        accumulate. Three recent examples are Thomas Pfau's decision to tie the
        discussion of <I>The Book of Urizen</I> in his new book on German and
        British Romanticism to our electronic edition of copy G instead of to a
        printed reproduction; and two definitive essays on Blake's "color
        printing" that would be unimaginable without the array of evidence from
        Archive images (Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi, "An Inquiry into
        Blake's Method of Color Printing" and "Blake's Method of Color
        Printing: Some Responses and Further Observations," <I>Blake/An
        Illustrated Quarterly</I>, Winter 2001/02 and Fall 2002,
        respectively)--see <A href="http://www.blakequarterly.org">www.blakequarterly.org</A>. An article
        announcing 9 previously unknown drawings discovered in the British
        Museum by the Archive editors when they photographed its collection is
        forthcoming in <I>Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</I>. John E. Grant and
        Mary Lynn Johnson have recently requested permission to use Blake
        Archive texts as the basis of their revised version of the printed
        Norton Critical Edition of Blake. For scholars, publishers, and others,
        the Archive has increasingly become a standard source of images and
        transcriptions of Blake's works for republication. Over the past year,
        the number of requests for use of Archive materials has increased
        dramatically.</P><P>The number of articles, reviews, and conference papers on the
        Archive project itself continues to increase. Recent examples include
        J. Hillis Miller's "Digital Blake," presented at the fall 2000
        conference of the Digital Cultures Project of the University of
        California, a multi-campus research group, and first published on the
        Project's web site, Stuart Peterfreund's essay-review in the
        <I>European Romantic Review</I>, and papers in Sheila Spector's session
        on "Blake Scholarship and the New Technology" at the annual MLA meeting
        (December 2002). Recent interviews and articles on the Archive by the
        editors on the Archive include:</P><BR/><BR/><P>"'Once Only Imagined': An Interview with Morris Eaves, Robert N.

        dissertation inspired by the Archive, Vladimir Misic's "The
        Segmentation and Compression of Images in the Blake Archive" (in
        progress, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of
        Rochester, due for completion in spring 2003). Most recently, the
        dissertation has involved active collaboration with Xerox Corporation.
        Rob Buckley of Xerox presented a paper on the subject, "Document
        Imaging on the Web with MRC [Multi-Raster Content, a Xerox technology]
        and JPEG 2000," at the invitation-only EVA [Electronic Imaging and the
        Visual Arts] Harvard Symposium, 2-3 October 2002. This collaboration
        shows promise of leading to further developments, including a working
        demonstration of Misic's innovative image-compression system--tailored
        to the problems of reproducing Blake's images--on the Blake Archive
        site.</P><P>The Archive has also achieved recognition for its status as an
        online humanities archive. EDSITEment (<A href="http://edsitement.neh.gov">http://edsitement.neh.gov</A>) chose the
        Archive as one of the "Best of the Humanities on the Web" in its
        Literature &amp; Language Arts category. EDSITEment brings together
        leading humanities resources, as selected by the National Endowment for
        the Humanities in partnership with the National Trust for the
        Humanities and the MarcoPolo Education Foundation. The Archive was also
        selected as "a groundbreaking hypermedia project" in the humanities by
        the Charles Babbage Institute. The Babbage Institute, the foremost
        archive for scholarly internet sites headquartered at the Center of
        Information Technology, University of Minnesota (<A href="http://www.cbi.umn.edu">http://www.cbi.umn.edu</A>), has acquired the
        Archive's project records and will be its official archivist. Most
        recently, the Archive received the 2003 Prize for a Distinguished
        Scholarly Edition awarded every two years by the Modern Language
        Assocation. This is the first time that the award has been given to an
        electronic edition. The selection committee's citation affirmed that
        "the William Blake Archive has set a high mark for future editorial
        practice through its clarity, user-friendliness, beauty, and
        erudition."</P><P>Meanwhile, one of our consultants, Matthew Kirschenbaum, is
        collaborating with the [University of] Maryland Institute for
        Technology in the Humanities on the development of an exciting new
        image viewer, the Virtual Lightbox, which will allow our users, guided
        by the familiar "shopping cart" metaphor, to collect images from across
        the site and import them into a display area where they can be freely
        arranged for comparison and manipulation. Virtual Lightbox 1.0 is ready
        for implementation, with additional features and functionality under
        development; we hope to incorporate it into the Archive as a Java
        applet in the near future.</P><P>Much of the work of the second phase has been behind the scenes,
        making editorial changes, creating prototypes, and running tests. These
        are precursors to basic revisions of the elements in the Blake Archive
        DTD (document text definition)--the SGML (standard generalized markup
        language) recipe, as it were, on which the Archive rests. We adopted a
        radical documentary-style line-numbering scheme capable of
        accommodating not just conventional printed literary texts, such as
        poetry, but any text--inscriptions, labels on engravings, signatures
        and imprints on engravings, monograms, and numbers. We revised the
        stylesheets that control the display of works, and we modified the
        "copy headers" and "object headers" that deliver fundamental
        bibliographical information about the images to the user. We are also
        using new transcription standards in the display of several of Blake's
        works. These new standards attempt to adhere to the shape of Blake's
        text more closely than we were previously able to reproduce in a
        digital medium. New servers installed at IATH in 2003 have noticeably
        improved access times, which will be increasingly important as the
        Archive continues to expand the number of works on the site.</P><P>We have now entered a new phase of active production and
        publication, as evidenced in our publication of three more copies of
        <I>Urizen</I>, the <I>Job</I> watercolors, and the many illuminated and
        non-illuminated works we have planned for production this spring,
        including <I>Urizen</I> copies B and D, the <I>Songs of Innocence and
        of Experience</I> copies A, B, T, V, and Y. We also plan to publish the
        <I>Book of Job</I> pencil sketches, engraved illustrations to Edward
        Young's <I>Night Thoughts</I>, the watercolor illustrations to two
        series of Milton's <I>Paradise Lost</I> and <I>Comus</I>, miscellaneous
        watercolor drawings and color prints, and the manuscript of Blake's
        <I>Island in the Moon</I>.</P><P>As always, there are areas of technological development. Our
        work-in-progress site is a veritable laboratory of ongoing
        experiments--no sooner is one completed than another is added.
        Additionally, we have just loaded all the data from our image
        production records into a new database, which will shortly be the means
        by which we track our workflow as the Archive continues to expand in
        new directions. We have also begun moving away from our DynaWeb
        interface and taking preliminary steps towards conversion of the markup
        of our texts from SGML to XML and/or other emerging text-encoding
        technologies that promise to provide a base on which to build a
        successor to DynaWeb.</P><P>In these and other areas, we have been making the difficult
        transition from a specialized to a generalized framework: from one
        capable of supporting a specialized collection (of illuminated books)
        to one capable of supporting a far broader combination of texts and
        images, plus extensive information about them and robust scholarly
        tools to manipulate them. Obviously, it is hard to predict in advance
        exactly where that broadening must occur: thus the prototypes and trial
        runs, which have a way of turning up unexpected anomalies. We chose
        Blake's <I>Illustrations of the Book of Job</I>, one of his
        masterpieces, because the basic configuration of image and text in the
        Job plates is different from that of the illuminated books--and thus
        presents different display problems--and because the images themselves
        are often very dense and crowded with elaborate details.</P><P>As we revise the infrastructure to accommodate a full range of
        materials, it becomes increasingly apparent that the expansion of the
        Archive will alter the environment for users. Though we have no
        intention of changing our base objective--to provide materials and
        tools for scholarship--we see that a broader Blake Archive will be able
        to address scholars and students together. Additional materials and
        improved tools provide what students, like scholars, need: more
        <I>starting points</I> for research and more useful connections among
        them.</P><P>After focusing on redesign and acquisition in recent years, we felt
        that we had reached a point where we could redirect our energy to
        publication. Even as we move ahead on other fronts--publishing full
        lists of the Blake collections of our contributors, additional
        illuminated books and non-illuminated materials, restyling the
        interface, etc.--we are aiming to make significant progress toward our
        ultimate goal of publishing the full range of Blake's work. In
        addition, we are preparing a study guide for the works of Blake as well
        as an article explaining illuminated printing. These are helpful, we
        believe, to nonspecialist users of the Archive, including the
        increasing number of students and teachers who use it in all levels of
        education, from grade school to graduate courses.</P><HR class="c2" width="70%" noshade="noshade"/><P class="c3"><A href="#top">Top</A> | <A href="#significance">Significance</A> | <A href="#history">History</A> |

        can access it via the World Wide Web. We are committed to the continued
        development and maintenance of a free site, for reasons we have
        outlined above.</P><P>One of the foremost advantages of electronic publication is the
        ability of the medium to accommodate growth and change. In one sense,
        then, a final product and date of publication never arrive, at least
        not as they do in the world of print. That said, by the end of 2003,
        the Archive will have expanded very nearly to its full intended shape.
        The intricate SGML architecture and stylesheets required to integrate
        and display the full range of Blake's works in all media will have been
        developed, and each category will include a meaningful selection of
        significant works. By the end of 2003 we hope the Blake Archive will
        have taken its place among the preeminent models of humanistic
        scholarship in the medium.</P><P>From the start we have encouraged feedback from users via an e-mail
        link (we routinely respond to inquiries and comments from users).
        Recently we began collecting statistics on the use of the Archive,
        using software that counts the number and duration of hits for the site
        as a whole and for individual works. We shall design a questionnaire to
        survey our users' purposes and their opinions about the site, which we
        shall evaluate with the help of our advisory board.</P><P>As the Archive has evolved from a demonstration site showing three
        short and unsearchable illuminated books to a fully functioning archive
        that incorporates (at this writing) complete editions of 50 copies of
        all of Blake's 19 illuminated books, its reputation has rapidly spread
        far beyond the community of Blake studies. The Archive is now linked to
        all the major search engines, scholarly reference sites (such as Voice
        of the Shuttle), compendia (such as Romantic Circles), and journals
        (such as Romanticism on the Net). By filling out a form at the site
        itself, users can now subscribe to Blake Archive Updates and
        automatically receive e-mail notices with the latest information; these
        notices are also regularly posted to several online discussion groups.
        As word of the Archive continues to spread, the number of articles,
        reviews, and papers-and of requests for our texts and images--
        continues to increase in both the mainstream and scholarly press (see
        <A href="../articles/index.html">Articles
        about the Archive</A>).</P><P>For the time being, the chief obstacle to ideal access is the
        familiar one: speed. We are designing the Archive with an eye to the
        technical improvements of the future. For now, however, we supply
        several partial remedies for the bandwidth restrictions of the present:
        (1) We give users options: higher-resolution images that are slower to
        load than our inline images are made available by links; users with
        less adequate equipment or outdated browsers may bypass our Java
        applets entirely at the click of a mouse. (2) We continue to update and
        refine our software for optimal efficiency with current browsers (Inote
        is frequently revised to keep up with changes in Java).</P><P>We are especially interested in establishing multiple or "mirror"
        sites to improve access time for users with less than optimal
        connections to the Internet. Since December 2001, the public Archive
        has been mirrored on a Sun server at Oxford University and maintained
        by Oxford University Computing Services.</P><P>Eventually we may publish selected resources from the Archive in a
        second form. Those who need speed and portability--teachers in their
        classrooms, for example--will eventually be able to buy, at a price
        that individuals can pay, major works on portable disks. These amount
        to an extension, for the sake of convenience, of parts of the Archive.
        Although we have discussed disk publication with interested academic
        and commercial publishers, we must determine what publication
        arrangements are best for the future of the project as a whole.</P><HR class="c2" width="70%" noshade="noshade"/><P class="c3"><A href="#top">Top</A> | <A href="#significance">Significance</A> | <A href="#history">History</A> |
