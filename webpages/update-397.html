    Update Files</A></DIV><P>20 March 1997</P><P>In late 1996 we were expecting to add new illuminated books to the Archive
  very soon. At the time our strategy called for us to move forward along two
  tracks: adding new illuminated books to the site in its present, rather
  straightforward form, and meanwhile, in the background, developing the tools
  that will produce the final, more elaborate form of the site in the long
  run.</P><P>You can do a lot, after all, even with the books already available at the
  site. You can move through the plates in any order, bring up transcriptions
  of the texts as needed, bring up enlargements of the plates to examine
  details, and open multiple windows in your Web browser to compare plates with
  one another.</P><P>But in the final version of the site, you'll be able to do much more. As
  we've explained before, you'll be able not only to search all the texts for
  any "text string" (sequence of characters or words) but also, more
  remarkably, to search the designs--the larger ones, the small interlinear
  ones, or both--to locate any component that interests you. In addition, if
  your browser is able to run programs written in the language called <A href="http://www.sun.co.jp:8080/java/">Java</A> (from <A href="http://www.sun.co.jp:8080/">Sun MicroSystems</A>) will be able to use an
  innovative Java applet (little application, or program) called <A href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~mar4g/">INote</A> to study the images
  in the Archive by looking at enlarged details and referring to the elaborate
  network of annotations that we are composing for every design. We've recently
  been developing a second Java applet that will automatically resize all
  images to their actual size, no matter what kind of monitor they are being
  displayed on.</P><P>Early this year, however, it began to dawn on us that we should
  concentrate entirely on the ultimate, enriched version of the Archive. We
  have also decided that we should offer two versions of the site: one
  "Java-enabled" for those whose Web browsers can run Java applets, and one for
  users whose browsers can't. These changes in our strategy have unfortunately
  prevented us from adding new works, but it has freed up the time, resources,
  and expertise to get much further than we otherwise could have with the
  development work required to put the site in its final form. Here's what we
  can now report:</P><BR/><BR/><DL><DD>
      1. The end of the crucial first phase of adapting our search software,
      DynaText (from <A href="http://www.ebt.com/">Electronic Book
      Technologies</A>), to the special textual-visual demands of the Archive
      is now in sight. All the elements--the pages where the illuminated books
      are displayed, the pages where text and image searches are launched, the
      Java applet INote and the Java applet that resizes images
      automatically--are in place and roughly coordinated.

      <BR/><BR/></DD><DD>
      2. A lot of new design work has been required to make our pages look the
      way we want them to look in the new environment created by the search
      software. Most of the major redesigning is finished, and we're now
      deciding on details--at this point it's more like choosing
      kitchen-cabinet hardware than building walls.

      <BR/><BR/></DD><DD>3. To make the site more useful, we are adding two basic research
    tools, a standard text-only edition and a bibliography: David V. Erdman's
    edition of <CITE>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</CITE>
    (without the commentary by Harold Bloom) and a fairly extensive list of
    books and articles on Blake.</DD></DL><P>The Erdman edition comes to us courtesy of David and Virginia Erdman and
  Nelson Hilton (University of Georgia), whose idea it originally was to put
  the Erdman edition <A href="http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~wblake/e-E.html">online</A>. Nelson has also
  done some of the SGML "tagging," final responsibility for which rests with
  our project manager, Amy Sexton at IATH, who is now in the home stretch for
  this particular part of the Archive. Once it is at our site--by early summer,
  we now think--you will be able to search it along with, or separate from, all
  the other texts and images in the Archive.</P><P>The list of useful works on Blake should be available at about the same
  time, and similarly searchable. The standard reference sources--catalogues
  and editions--will be there, of course, and the entire list will be
  cross-categorized under various subject headings, such as the titles of works
  (e.g., Jerusalem) and special interests (e.g., Blake's visual art).</P><P>In summary, here's what we expect to happen soon:</P><BR/><BR/><DL><DD>
      April 1997: We hope to have working versions of the two sites--one for
      browsers that can run Java, one for browsers that can't--to test and
      demonstrate at the public Blake Archive site.

      <BR/><BR/></DD><DD>
      Summer 1997: By early to mid-summer, the text and notes of the Erdman
      edition and the list of useful works will both be online and searchable.
      In the course of the summer, we expect to add new illuminated books to
      the Archive. Several of those books are ready and waiting in the wings,
      because we have continued to work on the basic materials of the Archive:
      first persuading major private and public collections to let us display
      the works that we think will give the Blake Archive its scholarly
      coherence and integrity; then the long process of acquiring images of
      those works, scanning them, color-correcting them, editing the texts,
      annotating the images, and encoding everything, texts and images, in SGML
      (Standard Generalized Markup Language), the common currency of our
      enterprise.

      <BR/><BR/></DD><DD>Among the books nearly ready for primetime are <CITE>All Religions are
    One</CITE> (copy A), <CITE>There is No Natural Religion</CITE> (copy C),
    <CITE>America</CITE> (copy E), <CITE>Europe</CITE> (copy B), <CITE>The Song
    of Los</CITE> (copies A and B), <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven and
    Hell</CITE> (copy D), <CITE>The Book of Urizen</CITE> (copy G), <CITE>Songs
    of Innocence and of Experience</CITE> (copy Z), <CITE>The Book of
    Ahania</CITE>, and <CITE>The Book of Los</CITE>.</DD></DL><P>[Morris Eaves, Robert N.
