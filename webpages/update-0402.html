  "Resources for Further Research," a new wing of the Archive. Intended to
  assist students and researchers seeking additional materials for the study of
  Blake, Resources includes collection lists for the Archive's contributing
  institutions and bibliographies of reference and scholarly sources pertaining
  to Blake. In addition, we've moved our electronic edition of David V.
  Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</I> to this new wing.
  Each of these resources is encoded in SGML and fully searchable. In the
  future, Resources will also include a Study Guide for using the Archive to
  explore Blake and his works.</P><P>The collection lists were prepared by the Archive editors in partnership
  with the curators of the contributing collections. Gathered in a single
  location, these handlists provide the most complete account available today
  of the various collections of Blake's work. The bibliographies were compiled
  by the Archive editors with the assistance of Denise Vultee. These
  bibliographies include a selection of the most important publications written
  in English about Blake and his work and should be considered a starting point
  for students and researchers. We will update the bibliographies on an annual
  basis.</P><P>At present the Archive contains 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
  books and the Thomas Butts set of Blake's water colors illustrating the Book
  of Job, now in the Pierpont Morgan Library. In the near future we expect to
  release more drawings and prints in Preview, a much-anticipated electronic
  edition of <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E, and further supplementary materials,
  including a biography and glossary.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
  cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
  generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
  the Archive.</P><P>We invite you to visit the Archive at <A href="http://www.blakearchive.org">www.blakearchive.org</A> or <A href="http://www.blakearchive.org.uk">www.blakearchive.org.uk</A> (British
