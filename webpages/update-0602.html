  Blake's twelve water-color illustrations to John Milton's poems "L'Allegro"
  and "Il Penseroso," now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. These
  splendid designs are published in our new Preview mode, one that provides all
  the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image
  annotation program). Each design is accompanied by a manuscript leaf that
  includes a quotation of the lines illustrated and brief interpretive comments
  by Blake. These manuscript leaves are also reproduced here in sequence
  following each design.</P><P>Produced for Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, c. 1816-20, the
  "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso" illustrations exhibit the delicacy and
  refinement typical of Blake's late water-color style. Milton's contrasting
  companion poems gave Blake yet another opportunity to explore his own sense
  of contrariety, much as he did earlier in his career in <I>Songs of Innocence
  and of Experience</I>. Through the careful selection of passages to
  illustrate, Blake also emphasizes the visionary and transformative moments in
  Milton's poems.</P><P>At present the Archive contains 45 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
  books (all fully searchable); the Thomas Butts set of Blake's water colors
  illustrating the Book of Job, also in the Pierpont Morgan Library; and now
  the first of several series of Milton illustrations that we will be adding in
  Preview. In the near future we expect to release more drawings and prints in
  Preview, a much-anticipated electronic edition of <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E,
  and further supplementary materials, including a biography and glossary.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
  cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
  generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
  the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
