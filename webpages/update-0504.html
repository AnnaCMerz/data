  electronic editions of <I>The Song of Los</I>, copies A and D. Both have been
  in the collection of the British Museum since the mid-nineteenth century;
  they join copy B from the Library of Congress, previously published in the
  Archive. Like all six extant copies of <I>The Song of Los</I>, A and D were
  richly color printed in 1795. With its divisions into sections titled
  "Africa" and "Asia," <I>The Song of Los</I> follows <I>America</I> (1793) and
  Europe (1794) as the last of Blake's "Continental Prophecies" that mingle
  contemporary events with a host of mythological motifs, both borrowed and
  invented.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
  Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
  major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
  Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
  Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
  museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
  their collections in the Archive.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
