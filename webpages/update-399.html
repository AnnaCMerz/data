  publication of three new electronic editions of Blake's most popular work,
  <I>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</I>. They are of copies C, F, and
  L--none has been reproduced before now.</P><P><I>Songs</I> copy C is one of the first copies of the combined
  <I>Songs</I>. Along with copies B, D, and E, it was formed in 1794 of
  <I>Innocence</I> plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in
  1789 and <I>Experience</I> plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in
  the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move plates 34-36
  ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") to <I>Experience</I>,
  but since plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf with plate 26 ("A
  Dream"), plate 26 is read in this copy, as well as in copies B and D, as an
  <I>Experience</I> poem. And, like copies B and D, copy C is missing plate 52
  ("To Tirzah") but has the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs
  carrying a naked figure), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here
  as a tailpiece. Copy C is in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of
  Congress.</P><P>Bibliographically, copy F is even more interesting. It, too, consists of
  two sections printed differently and at different times. Its <I>Innocence</I>
  plates were printed in green ink on both sides of the leaf in 1789, probably
  before the raw sienna printing. Its <I>Experience</I> plates were heavily
  color printed on one side of the leaf in 1794, before those in copy C,
  possibly while <I>Experience</I> was still in progress. The impressions of
  <I>Experience</I> were printed with those now in <I>Songs</I> copies G, H,
  and T, which are all missing plates 39, 44, 45, and 48. Together, these four
  plates form one sheet of copper. The fact that all four plates are missing
  from all four copies suggests that the plates were not yet part of
  <I>Experience</I> at the time of this printing. These four color-printed
  copies of <I>Experience</I> appear to have been intended as autonomous
  publications. At any rate, there are no extant sets of <I>Innocence</I>
  impressions printed in this style, copies G and H remain without
  <I>Innocence</I>, and copies F and T were assembled by someone other than
  Blake.</P><P><I>Songs</I> copy L, like copy F, is in the Yale Center for British Art.
  Unlike copies C and F, though, its two parts were printed together in a
  uniform style, dark brown ink on one side of the leaf, ca. 1795. It has all
  54 plates, including plate 52, that make up the combined <I>Songs</I> and is
  numbered by Blake 1-54.</P><P>All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and all are
  fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote
  and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have
  twenty-nine copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. We will soon
  be adding two more copies of <I>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I> and an
  in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways
  to use its resources. We will continue to add new electronic editions of
  illuminated books throughout the spring and summer.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, Joseph Viscomi, Editors<BR/>
