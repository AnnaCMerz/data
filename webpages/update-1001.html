  publication of new electronic editions of <I>The Marriage of Heaven and
  Hell</I> copy G and <I>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</I> copy P, both
  printed c. 1818. This is the first reproduction of <I>Marriage</I> copy G and
  the first full color reproduction of <I>Visions</I> copy P since the
  badly-degraded filmstrips produced by Micro Methods Ltd. in the 1970s.</P><P><I>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I> copy G is in the Houghton Library,
  Harvard University, and <I>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</I> copy P is
  in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. They join copies of <I>Marriage</I> and
  <I>Visions</I> from other printings: <I>Marriage</I> copies C (1790), H
  (1790/1821), F (1794), D (1795), and I (1827), and <I>Visions</I> copies C
  and J (1793), F (1794), and G (1795). Other copies of <I>Marriage</I> and
  <I>Visions</I> are forthcoming: <I>Marriage</I> copy K (plates 21-24) and
  copies L and M (plates 25-27), from the first printing of the plates in 1790,
  with plates 24 and 25 in first states; and <I>Visions</I> copy O, printed
  with copy P.</P><P>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
  text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and
  ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. With the Archive's
  recently added comparison feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple
  impressions of any plate across the different copies of an illuminated
  book.</P><P>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully
  searchable and scalable electronic editions of 45 copies of 18 of Blake's 19
  illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each
  work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions
  of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable
  SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry and
  Prose of William Blake</I>. With the forthcoming publication of
  <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of each
  of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of most.</P><P><I>Marriage</I> copy G, one of nine extant copies, is the only copy with a
  variant plate order (1-11, 15, 14, 12, 13, 16-27) that can be traced directly
  to Blake, and it is the first of his last two copies in which the cave and
  rock forms on plates 10, 11, 15, and 20 were printed. These forms were part
  of the original designs as executed on the plates but were wiped of ink in
  all earlier copies and thus did not print; they show up only in this copy and
  copy I.</P><P>The early histories of <I>Marriage</I> copy G and <I>Visions</I> copy P
  are not known, but they were bound together (with <I>The Book of Thel</I>
  copy N) until 1890. They also share the same printing session and printing
  and coloring styles. Both are printed in red-orange ink on one side of RUSE
  &amp; TURNERS/1815 paper and finished in watercolors and pen and ink. Each
  impression is numbered in the top right corner and bordered by one thin line
  drawn in red-orange ink a little over a centimeter around the image, setting
  off each page like a miniature painting. These extraordinarily beautiful
  copies were produced in the same session with other books in the Archive:
  <I>The Book of Thel</I> copy O and <I>The Book of Urizen</I> copy G. This
  late style, which Blake also used c. 1821-22 and 1825-27, can be seen in
  other books in the Archive: <I>America a Prophecy</I> copy O and <I>Europe a
  Prophecy</I> copy K, published earlier this year, <I>Songs of Innocence and
  of Experience</I> copies Z and AA, and <I>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I>
  copy I.</P><P>The editors of the Archive recently photographed over 1250 works by Blake
  in the British Museum, Department of Prints and Drawings, including all 537
  water colors illustrating Edward Young's <I>Night Thoughts</I> and hundreds
  of pencil sketches (nine newly discovered), drawings, and watercolors. Over
  the next few years, we will be adding this extensive collection of books,
  prints, and drawings to the Archive. Many of these works will be reproduced
  in color for the first time.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
