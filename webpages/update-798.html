  publication of six new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They
  are:</P><BR/><BR/><UL><LI><CITE>All Religions are One</CITE> copy A</LI><LI><CITE>There is No Natural Religion</CITE> copies B, C, G, and L</LI><LI><CITE>Milton, a Poem</CITE> copy C</LI></UL><P>Composed and executed in 1788, <CITE>All Religions are One</CITE> and
  <CITE>There is No Natural Religion</CITE> are Blake's first works in
  illuminated printing, though no copy of either work survives from this date.
  The ten plates of <CITE>All Religions</CITE> were followed quickly by twenty
  <CITE>No Natural Religion</CITE> plates in two antithetical sets (a and b
  series). Only one copy of <CITE>All Religions</CITE> is extant, now in the
  Huntington Library, printed c. 1795 with and in the same style as <CITE>There
  is No Natural Religion</CITE> copy L, the only copy consisting exclusively of
  the ten b-series of plates, now in The Pierpont Morgan Library. The other
  twelve recorded copies of this book consist of a mixture of the same eight to
  twelve plates, which appeared to be merely incomplete sets of proofs until it
  was discovered that six of these copies were 19th-century reproductions. Once
  the inauthentic impressions were weeded out, it became apparent that what
  remained was Blake's selection of a and b plates for an abridged version of
  the work printed around 1794. We present copies B, C, and G of this
  twelve-plate work, now in the collections of the Yale Center for British Art,
  Library of Congress, and The Pierpont Morgan Library, respectively.</P><P>There are only four copies of <CITE>Milton</CITE>, Blake's most personal
  epic. Copy C, from the New York Public Library, was Blake's own copy. Printed
  c. 1811, it was later reconfigured and renumbered by Blake when he inserted
  extra plates, which he appears to have done on at least two different
  occasions.</P><P>All of these editions have newly edited texts and are all fully searchable
  for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer
  applications described in our previous updates.</P><P>We now have twenty-two copies of thirteen illuminated books. Over this and
  next year, we will be adding Blake's last illuminated works, <CITE>On Homers
  Poetry [&amp;] On Virgil</CITE>, <CITE>The Ghost of Abel</CITE>, and
  <CITE>Laocoon</CITE>, as well as <CITE>Milton</CITE> copy D and
  <CITE>Jerusalem</CITE> copy E. We will also be adding at least six more
  copies of <CITE>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</CITE>, two copies of
  <CITE>Songs of Innocence</CITE>, five copies of <CITE>The Marriage of Heaven
  and Hell</CITE>, four copies of <CITE>The Book of Urizen</CITE>, and two
  copies each of <CITE>America, a Prophecy</CITE> and <CITE>Europe, a
  Prophecy</CITE>. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V.
  Erdman's <CITE>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</CITE>.</P><P>We will continue to post updates on various lists every few months, but
  readers interested in the progress of the Archive can subscribe to our Blake
  Update list, which can be found on the Archive's Contents Page. On this page
  readers will also find that we have opened the top level of the Contributing
  Institutions Page, which provides contact information and links to
  institutions participating in the Archive. In the coming months, we plan to
  include color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake
  collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is
  forthcoming.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, Joseph Viscomi</P><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="./urizen.G.P5.detail.jpg" width="581" height="410" alt="The Book of Urizen, copy G, plate 5, Library of Congress"/></DIV><BR/><BR/><HR/><P><A href="../main.html"><IMG src="../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake
