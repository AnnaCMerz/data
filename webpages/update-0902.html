  publication of new electronic editions of three copies of <I>The [First] Book
  of Urizen</I>. Copies A, C, and F were beautifully and extensively color
  printed in the same printing session in 1794. This is the first time that
  copies C and F have been reproduced, and the first reproduction of copy A
  since 1929.</P><P>Copies A and C are in the Yale Center for British Art, Yale University,
  and copy F is in the Houghton Library, Harvard University. These three copies
  join copy G, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress, and together
  comprise half the extant copies of <I>The [First] Book of Urizen</I>. Two
  other copies of <I>Urizen</I>, copy D, from the 1794 printing and copy B from
  the 1795 printing, are forthcoming.</P><P>Blake etched in shallow relief the twenty-eight plates of <I>The [First]
  Book of Urizen</I> in 1794, although only copies A and B contain them all. In
  the same year, he printed proof copies H and I (only 3 and 2 plates
  respectively) and copies A, C, D, E, F, and J. Copy B was printed the
  following year as part of a set of large-paper copies of the illuminated
  books and copy G was printed in 1818. Plate 4 appears only in copies A-C (an
  impression was pulled for copy G but not included). The full-page designs are
  differently positioned in each copy; copies A, B, E, and F also have variant
  orders of text plates.</P><P>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
  images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
  text and images are fully searchable and supported by the Inote and
  ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. With the Archive's
  recently added comparison feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple
  impressions of any plate across the different copies of an illuminated book.
  New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller
  documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all the <I>Urizen</I>
  texts, including previously published copy G.</P><P>With the publication of these three copies, the Archive now contains fully
  searchable and scalable electronic editions of 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19
  illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each
  work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions
  of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join the Thomas Butts
  set of Blake's watercolors illustrating the Book of Job, and Blake's twelve
  water-color illustrations to John Milton's poems "L'Allegro" and "Il
  Penseroso," the first of several series of Milton illustrations that we will
  be adding in Preview mode. In the near future we expect to release more
  drawings and prints in Preview mode, which provides all the features of the
  Archive except Image Search and Inote, a much-anticipated electronic edition
  of <I>Jerusalem</I> copy E, and further supplementary materials, including a
  biography and glossary.</P><P>The editors of the Archive recently photographed 125 works by Blake in the
  Department of Prints and Drawings, National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C.,
  including biblical watercolors, pencil drawings, and proofs in various states
  of the Job engravings. We have obtained reproductions of the Blake
  collections of the Fogg Museum of Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, the
  Metropolitan Museum, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and the
  Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Over the next few years, we will be adding
  to the Archive these extensive collections of books, prints, and drawings,
  many of which will be reproduced in color for the first time.</P><P>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
  restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
  through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
  the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
  Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the
  cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have
  generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in
  the Archive.</P><P>You can access the William Blake Archive at http://www.blakearchive.org
  and at our UK mirror at http://www.blakearchive.org.uk</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi, editors<BR/>
