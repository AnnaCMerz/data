  http://www.iath.virginia/edu/blake are pleased to announce the publication of
  four new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are:</P><BR/><BR/><UL><LI><I>The Ghost of Abel</I> copy A (The Library of Congress)</LI><LI><I>On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</I> copies B (The Fitzwilliam
    Museum) and F (The Pierpont Morgan Library)</LI><LI><I>LaocoÃ¶n</I> copy B (collection of Robert N. Essick)</LI></UL><P>These three works are Blake's final illuminated books, their composition
  dateable between 1822 (<I>The Ghost of Abel</I>, <I>On Homers Poetry [and] On
  Virgil</I>) and c. 1826-27 (<I>LaocoÃ¶n</I>). In the words of Sir Geoffrey
  Keynes, they offer Blake's "Last Testament" on subjects ranging from
  aesthetic theory to political economy, from forgiveness to apocalyptic
  judgment. A drama in miniature, <I>The Ghost of Abel</I> addresses "Lord
  Byron in the Wilderness" (plate 1) and, more specifically, the issues of
  vengeance and forgiveness raised by Byron's <I>Cain: A Mystery</I> (1821).
  The broadsheet <I>On Homers Poetry [and] On Virgil</I> challenges these
  representative figures of classical learning, with special emphasis on
  concepts of unity as an artistic ideal, identity, and the destructive
  consequences of imperialism. There are five copies extant for each of these
  works, which, like most of Blake's illuminated books, were produced in relief
  etching; the <I>LaocoÃ¶n</I> plate, which is an intaglio etching/engraving, is
  extant in two copies. Through a careful representation and restoration of the
  famous Hellenistic sculptural group, Blake attempts to return the
  <I>LaocoÃ¶n</I> to its supposed Hebraic origins and its allegorical meanings,
  revealed by the terse yet intellectually expansive texts with which Blake
  surrounds the central image.</P><P>All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and are all
  fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote
  and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have
  twenty-six copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. Late this year
  and early in the next, we will add <I>Milton</I> copy D and <I>Jerusalem</I>
  copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of <I>Songs of
  Innocence and of Experience</I>, two copies of <I>Songs of Innocence</I>,
  five copies of <I>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</I>, four copies of <I>The
  Book of Urizen</I>, and two copies each of <I>America, a Prophecy</I> and
  <I>Europe, a Prophecy</I>. In addition, by the end of 1998 we will provide a
  fully-searchable SGML edition of David V. Erdman's <I>Complete Poetry and
  Prose of William Blake</I>.</P><P>In the coming weeks we will also be opening a brand-new wing of the
  Archive, consisting of an extensive array of supporting materials: an updated
  and expanded Plan of the Archive, a statement of Editorial Principles and
  Methodology, a summary of the Archive's technical design and implementation,
  a list of Frequently Asked Questions, an in-depth illustrated Tour
  highlighting the Archive's features and some ways to use its resources, and
  more. Our hope is that these extensive documentary materials will prove
  valuable both to our own growing user community as well as to scholars
  interested in the theory and practice of electronic editing more generally.
  We will make a separate announcement when these materials are available on
  the site.</P><P>Finally, on our recently opened Contributing Collections page, we plan to
  begin adding color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake
  collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is
  forthcoming. In addition to providing a convenient index of the scope and
  contents of the Archive, these lists should also be useful to scholars in
  planning research trips.</P><P>Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, Joseph Viscomi</P><BR/><BR/><DIV class="c1"><IMG src="./urizen.G.P5.detail.jpg" width="581" height="410" alt="The Book of Urizen, copy G, plate 5, Library of Congress"/></DIV><BR/><BR/><HR/><P><A href="../main.html"><IMG src="../dwicons/home_milton.jpg"/>Blake
