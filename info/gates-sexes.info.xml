      Paradise,</cite> giving the work a new title, reworking the design

      plates at least twice, and adding three new text plates at the end

      (19-21). All twenty-one plates are intaglio etchings/engravings.

      Plates 19-20 contain brief interpretive statements keyed by number

      to the preceding design plates. The final plate is addressed to

      Satan as the "God of This [fallen] World."</p><p>Copies A and B were probably printed c. 1820. Copies C and D,

      plus a large group of impressions never collated into complete

      copies by Blake but now divided into what are designated as copies

J-L, N, date from c. 1825. Copies E-I are probably posthumous. Copy M, as listed in G. E. Bentley, Jr., <i>Blake Books Supplement</i> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pages 78-79, is a group of facsimiles by William Muir.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><relationship>Copy A, c. 1820<br/>
