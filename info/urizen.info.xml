<info id="urizen"><worktitle><div id="URIZEN.title"><h1><i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i></h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="URIZEN.top"><p>With its double columns of text and divisions into chapters and

      verses, the format of <cite>The [First] Book of Urizen</cite>

      indicates its close relationship to the Bible. The poem is in many

      respects a heterodox rewriting of Genesis, one in which the

      creation of the universe is seen as a fall into materiality and its

      abstract laws. The process is initiated by Urizen when he separates

      himself from his fellow "Eternals" and thereby creates difference,

      absence, and self-consciousness. As Urizen falls into this void of

      his own making, Los reacts by building a material and temporal base

      below which Urizen cannot descend. Through this narrative of

      ultimate origins, Blake explores fundamental epistemological and

      ontological issues.</p><p>Blake etched in shallow relief the twenty-eight plates of

      <cite>The [First] Book of Urizen</cite> in 1794, although only

      copies A and B contain them all. In the same year, he printed proof

      copies H and I (only 3 and 2 plates respectively) and copies A,

      C-F, and J. Copy B was printed in 1795 and copy G in 1818. Bentley 

      plate 4 appears only in copies A-C (an impression was pulled for 

      copy G but not included). The full-page designs are differently 

      positioned in each copy; copies A, B, E, and F also have variant 

      orders of text plates.</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship><link type="copy" ptr="urizen.a">Copy A, 1794</link><br/>
