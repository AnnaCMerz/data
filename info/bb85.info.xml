This group, designated Copy A of *A Large Book of Designs* and now in the British Museum, includes the design only from *Visions of the Daughters of Albion* Plate 7, a rejected plate from *America* with fragments of its text obscured by the printed colors to create a design usually entitled “A Dream of Thiralatha,” four full-page designs etched in relief, and two plates originally etched and engraved in intaglio. These last two, “Albion rose” and “The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder,” were color printed from their surfaces, not the incised lines, to create prints similar to those pulled from millboards used in the large color prints designed and executed the previous year.</p><p>         

Although apparently bound together at one time, Blake did not stab the leaves and may have issued *A Large Book of Designs* Copy A as unbound color prints. The impressions are not numbered and do not appear to constitute a sequential series. When Blake was printing Copy A for Humphry, he apparently pulled an impression of each plate to build up his stock of works. The thinner color printing in these latter impressions indicates that they are second pulls with little if any addition of color to the copperplates. This group, often referred to as Copy B of *A Large Book of Designs*, is now dispersed into several collections. There is no evidence that Copy B was issued by Blake as a sequential series; it does not constitute a “copy” or even a “work” as usually defined. </p></div></remarks><related><relationship>*Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain*<br/>
