         The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years.  As he told John 
         Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, "Milton lovd me in childhood &amp; shewd me his face" (Erdman page 707).  Several 
         early drawings, such as the <i>Satan, Sin, and Death</i> of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton.  
         In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i> in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see 
         Related Works, below).  He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when 
         the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for <i>Comus</i> (Butlin 527).  
         
         In about 1815, Blake produced the second set of <i>Comus</i> designs presented here (Butlin 528).  These were acquired,
         and probably commissioned, by Thomas Butts, Blake's main patron for his paintings and water colors.  The approximate
         date of composition is established by stylistic considerations (see Butlin).  This later group pictures the same eight
         subjects as the Thomas set, but with many significant differences in motifs and in the positions and portrayals of
         characters from the poem.  When offered at auction in 1853, the Butts set were sold "with the artist's descriptions,"
         apparently on separate leaves, like those accompanying Blake's illustrations to Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso"
         (Butlin 543).  These descriptions are untraced.

         Here, as usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' works, Blake paid close attention to the text, but 
         this disciplined approach did not preclude his 
         own interpretations.  For example, Milton ends his 
         masque with joyous dance and song, but Blake ends his illustrations on a more serious note, as indicated by the 
         facial expressions of all six figures.  The selection of passages to illustrate in itself reveals Blake's emphasis 
         on unusual states of consciousness, including trances and visions.

         Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book 
         <i>Milton a Poem</i>.
