                        <p><cite>To the Public</cite>, dated "October 10, 1793, "first came to light in
                                Gilchrist’s <cite>Life of Blake</cite>,1863, where it was introduced with a brief
                                heading that described “a characteristic Prospectus issued by
                                Blake." It had been transcribed from an “original . . . in engraved
                                writing printed in blue on a single leaf about 11 x 7 ½ inches . . .
                                obtained only at the last moment” from a "Mr. Frost"—perhaps William
                                Edward Frost, a painter, member of the Royal Academy, and sometime
                                collector of engravings by Blake's friend Thomas Stothard (Bentley,
                                <cite>Blake Books Supplement</cite> page 142). Like several of Blake’s letters,
                                then, his 1793 prospectus is known only from the transcription of
                                unknowable accuracy from Gilchrist's biography. </p>

                        <p> Blake was 35 when he published his prospectus. He and his wife were
                                living in Lambeth, a suburb on the south side of the Thames, in a
                                combination of living quarters, workshop, and retail shop. In one
                                respect the prospectus is just a one-page advertisement for a
                                youngish engraver trying to draw attention to his wares, with an
                                opening pitch followed by a list of works and prices, phrased in the
                                conventionally boastful, class-conscious advertising diction of its
                                day: "Mr. Blake's powers of invention very early engaged the
                                attention of many persons of eminence and fortune; by whose means he
                                has been regularly enabled to bring before the Public works (he is
                                not afraid to say) of equal magnitude and consequence with the
                                productions of any age or country." </p>

                        <p> In other ways the prospectus punches, as they say, far above its weight.
                                Its opening paragraph makes the startling claim that this engraver
                                has solved the age-old problem of "the Artist, the Poet, the
                                Musician, [who] have been proverbially attended by poverty and
                                obscurity." He pinpoints their fundamental dilemma, the inability to
                                reach "the Public" across commercial barriers. Middlemen—publishers,
                                printers, shop owners in control of the means of production and
                                distribution— have been able to block the free expression of artists
                                "owing to a neglect of means to propagate such works as have wholly
                                absorbed the Man of Genius." This 35-year-old engraver is not
                                thinking of himself as a mere copyist but as an artist who belonged
                                in the company of Britain’s greatest painters and poets: "Even
                                Milton and Shakespeare could not publish their own works." </p>

                        <p> In his opening paragraph Blake implicitly bills himself as an amalgam of
                                Prince and Elon Musk, a great artist who has discovered a technology
                                that can set others free. He is an entrepreneur offering a method
                                with the potential to liberate the artist and the audience,
                                previously thwarted through no fault of their own ("never the fault
                                of the Public"), to commune freely and openly for the first time.
                                This is to be accomplished by a revolutionary “method of Printing
                                both Letter-press"—that is, texts—and "Engraving"—that is,
                                pictures—"in a style" both grander and cheaper than heretofore
                                possible. Blake implicitly claims that his invention would allow
                                writers and artists to create and publish their works even if they
                                were not trained engravers or letterpress printers. And, for several
                                of his own works, Blake uses the language that has seemed to his
                                posterity best fitted to label the products of his new technology:
                                "Illuminated Books" in "Illuminated Printing"—phrases he never uses
                                again. </p>

                        <p> Like so many visionary startups that promise to disrupt the status quo
                                and replace it with liberating new technology, Blake's was a
                                failure. It did not spread to the artistic community as he imagines
                                it might, by introducing learnable handmade elements in a composite
                                medium capable of delivering, in any combination, anything that
                                could be written or drawn and thus displace a prevailing system that
                                had led the audience to expect, as the norm, mechanical regularity
                                in specialized media. </p>

                        <p> Even his own use of his autographic medium probably played a large part
                                in severely limiting his audience during his lifetime. Only decades
                                later did mid-Victorian sponsors identify the problem and begin to
                                separate Blake's words from his pictures and foster the production
                                of conventional editions of poetry that could be printed, published,
                                and sold alongside Milton, Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Browning. With
                                that radical move, "the Public" that Blake never blamed for his
                                failures began slowly to convene and expand into the worldwide
                                audience that we take for granted today. In a late reversal of
                                fortune, that appreciative audience has found in the original
                                composite form of "Illuminated Printing" Blake’s most tantalizing
                                body of artistic work. </p>
