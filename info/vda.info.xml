<info id="vda"><worktitle><div id="VDA.title"><h1><i>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</i></h1></div></worktitle><remarks><div id="VDA.top"><p>Oothoon, the central figure in the poem, plucks the "flower" of

      female sexuality but is soon raped by Bromion. Her lover,

      Theotormon, responds with silence or useless abstractions. This

      slender plot is but a thread on which Blake hangs Oothoon's

      questionings of conventional morality. She insists on her inner

      purity and, in a long concluding lament to the "Daughters of

      Albion," on the varieties of energetic self-expression that cannot

      be delimited by materialist philosophies or legalistic codes. The

      characters and their words represent Blake's critique of

      colonialism, slavery, sexual repression, and attitudes towards

      women in his day.</p><p>The eleven plates of <cite>Visions</cite> were etched in relief,

      with slight touches of white-line work, and first printed in 1793.

      This printing produced twelve copies: proof copy a (black ink,

      plates 1-2 and the designs only of plates 3, 7, 9-10), B and C (raw

      sienna ink), A, D, and E (yellow ochre ink), and H-M (green ink).

      There were only three later printings: 1794 (color-printed copies F

      and R), 1795 (large-paper copy G and possibly untraced copy Q), and

      1818 (copies N-P).</p></div></remarks><related><relHeader>All Known Copies</relHeader><subHeader>This list includes untraced copies known only from sales catalogues.</subHeader><relationship><link type="copy" ptr="vda.a-proof">Copy a (proofs), 1793</link><br/>
