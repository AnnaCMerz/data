                    <illusobjdesc>Near the center of the composition, a standing male(?) figure faces forward yet turns his head left, perhaps to look toward a group of at least three figures standing behind some sort of low horizontal structure near the left edge of the drawing.  The central figure wears a long gown with a sash or length of drapery diagonally draped across his chest; the fabric extends over his left shoulder, ending in a serpentine flourish.  Pentimenti to the right of this figure suggest he was originally positioned further to the right.  He may have long hair, perhaps worn in a braid over his left shoulder, and in his right hand he holds a sword, which is pointed downward to touch the right shoulder of a reclining, defeated figure facing away from the viewer.  This male figure appears nude from the waist up and twists his torso to the left with his left arm bent and braced on the ground.  Near the right edge of the drawing, a female figure wearing a long gown stands facing away from the viewer and looks left.  With both arms bent, she appears to hold or lead the horse at right that also faces left.  Between this figure and the horse, there is a shorter figure very faintly drawn who appears to face left with one arm extended backward (perhaps to touch the horse?) and wear a gown.  The smaller size of this figure suggests it is a child.  Indeterminate horizontal lines in the upper register of the drawing may suggest distant hills.</illusobjdesc>
