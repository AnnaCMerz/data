                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>This experimental relief plate has three main sections. The upper portion of the plate depicts a nude male figure who faces forward and is visible from the shoulders down. The figure may sit on a small mound or kneel on his bent right knee. His left leg is bent and in front of his body. The figure's left arm is bent and he appears to grasp a severed human head that faces up and right with his left hand at right. The figure's left arm is either not visible or distorted to appear more snake-like against his body at left. A bird with outstretched wings flies in an area of sky in the upper left corner of the design, and an indeterminate form is visible below and right of the bird. A cat is visible below the severed head at right. Lines and other forms on the ground below the figure may indicate grass or other vegetation. Additional indeterminate vegetation may be visible above the figure's hand at right. The middle section of the plate is smaller than the surrounding designs and depicts a series of geometric and linear designs. The top row of designs includes a triangle at left, a circle at center, and a square at right, as well as several linear forms in between and around the row. A shape suggesting a crescent moon is visible below the square at right. A semi-circular line surrounds the lower portion of the middle section. Both straight and squiggled lines are visible inside the semi-circle. Like the upper portion, the third, lowest portion of the plate depicts a nude male figure who faces forward and is visible from the shoulders down. The figure appears to sit on grassy ground or kneel on his right knee; his body is twisted or bent to the left. His left leg is bent forward. His right arm is bent and at his side with his left hand braced against the ground at left. His left arm is bent at a right angle and his left hand is also braced on the ground or a rock at right. Below his left hand, two severed heads that face forward are visible in the lower right corner. Additional indeterminate vegetation may be visible above the figure's hand at right. Horizontal lines to the left and right of the figure's torso may suggest beams of light in a background sky.</illusobjdesc>
