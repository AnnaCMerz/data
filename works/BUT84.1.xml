                    <illusobjdesc>In this illustration of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">Romeo and Juliet</hi>, Juliet is depicted from the waist up in profile facing left.  Contrary to the title, the scene is likely the moment before Juliet falls asleep after drinking a potion to make her appear dead to avoid an arranged marriage to Count Paris and thus remain true to Romeo.  Juliet wears a loose garment, perhaps classically styled drapery, and her long curly hair cascades down both shoulders. She rests her bent right arm on an indistinguishable object (possibly a pillow) at left and holds a golden chalice in her left hand, which she raises to her lips with her bent right arm.  With her head bent down and perhaps a tear visible below her eye, Juliet uses her right hand to raise the round object set inside the chalice to her parted lips.  This object may be the vial described in Act 4, Scene 3: "My dismal scene I needs must act alone./Come, vial. [She takes out the vial.]" (20-21). In the final line of the scene, Juliet drinks the potion and collapses on her bed: "Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink. I drink to/ thee. [She drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtains.]" (59-60).</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Probably an illustration of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">Henry IV, Part I</hi>, the scene depicts two male figures in an oval composition.  The figure at left, who is older and bearded, faces forward and slightly right.  His mouth may be open, suggesting he is speaking.  He raises his right arm to touch the chest of the younger figure at right who is seen in profile facing left.  This figure has short curly hair and wears a red garment with fashionable slashed sleeves. He rests his bent left arm on a table(?) in the lower right foreground and his right arm, which is bent upward, on the left shoulder of his companion.  Both men wear round hats with a large plume.  The older figure is probably Falstaff, a disgraced knight and constantly drunk comic character, while the more youthful figure likely represents Prince Hal, the rebellious heir to the British throne and son of King Henry IV. In the early acts of <hi rend="i">Henry IV, Part I</hi>, Falstaff acts as a sort of father figure to Prince Hal, and the pair spends much time together drinking and bantering in a pub, which may be the setting of this illustration.  Their relationship sours, however, in <hi rend="i">Henry IV, Part II</hi> when Prince Hal overhears Falstaff falsely bragging and insulting Hal, who later turns Falstaff away from court after he ascends the throne as Henry V.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Probably an illustration of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">Henry IV, Part I</hi>, the scene depicts two male figures in an oval composition.  The figure at left, who is older with long hair and a beard, faces forward and slightly right.  His mouth may be open, suggesting he is speaking.  He raises his right arm and extends two fingers to touch the chest of the younger figure at right toward whom he also looks.  Both men wear round hats with a large plume; the older figure's shirt includes a prominent collar and cuffs.  The older figure is probably Falstaff, a disgraced knight and constantly drunk comic character who acts as a sort of father figure to Prince Hal, the younger figure, in the first acts of <hi rend="i">Henry IV, Part I</hi>.</illusobjdesc>

The younger male figure at right has short curly hair and wears a red garment with fashionable slashed sleeves. He rests his bent left arm on a table(?) in the lower right foreground and his right arm, which is bent upward, on the left shoulder of his companion toward whom he also looks.  Like his companion at left, he wears a round hat with a large plume.  This figure is likely Prince Hal, the rebellious heir to the British throne and son of King Henry IV.</characteristic>

                    <illusobjdesc>Othello and Desdemona, two of the main characters in Shakespeare’s play <hi rend="i">Othello</hi>, hold hands in a partial embrace in this illustration.  Othello, the male figure at left, has short curly hair and dark skin.  He appears to wear a cape(?) over metallic armor, which likely corresponds to his position as a general in the Venetian military.  Although he faces forward, with head tilted he looks imploringly right toward his female companion Desdemona, whose hand he holds with his bent right arm.  His left hand is visible, though sketchy, above Desdemona’s right hip, as if his arm is extended around her waist in a partial embrace.  Desdemona looks toward Othello in profile facing left.  She wears a long veil and gown, and this garment, along with her pale skin, contrasts sharply with Othello’s in color.  In Act 5, Scene 2, he describes “that whiter skin of hers than snow,/ And smooth as monumental alabaster” (5). Her left arm is bent upward and held in front of her body by Othello.  She extends her bent right arm across her chest with right fingers touching her left arm.  The scene likely illustrates the exchange between the characters in Act 3, Scene 4, in which Othello, convinced Desdemona is adulterous, grabs her hand: “Give me your hand. [He takes her hand] This hand/ is moist, my lady.” (41-2) He continues: “Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires/A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,/ Much castigation, exercise devout;/ For here’s a young and sweating devil here/ That commonly rebels. ‘Tis a good hand/ A frank one.” (44-50). Unable to overcome his jealousy provoked by Iago’s lies, Othello smothers Desdemona on their bed and, upon learning the truth, kills himself in despair.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Two figures look toward each other as the woman at left touches the arm of the male figure at right.  Depicted in profile facing right, the female figure has her long hair arranged in a bun and wears a gown(?) with a belt and a shawl over her shoulders. She extends her raised right arm to the right and points with her index finger.  Her bent left arm rests on the right forearm of her companion, who faces forward but turns slightly left to look toward her.  The male figure has short curly hair and a bushy beard and mustache. His mouth may be open, perhaps suggesting he is speaking.  He wears long-sleeved armor. His right arm is bent and held in front of his chest; he may hold an indistinguishable object in his right hand. His left arm is bent and raised near his throat. He may touch his chest with his raised left hand. This pair of figures is likely Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth from Shakespeare's play <hi rend="i">Macbeth</hi>, perhaps depicted during one of their many conversations about plotting to gain greater political power.</illusobjdesc>
