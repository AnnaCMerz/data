            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the

                international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us

                        Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of several tree trunks.  Job, the rightmost male figure, faces forward and lifts his head to look up with raised eyes.  Tears stream down his face. He is old with long hair and a beard, and he wears a gown. Both arms are slightly bent and at his sides with palms facing up and forward, fingers spread.  His knees are bent upward toward his chest. Job's wife, the second figure from the right, is a gowned female who sits facing forward but turns her head to look right toward Job with raised eyes. She has long curly hair and wears sandals. Her mouth is open.  Her knees are bent forward toward her chest, and she wraps both bent arms around her knees with her hands together, fingers intertwined, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. Only the head and one hand of the third figure from the right, who is male, are visible.  This is probably Zophar.  He faces forward and right and appears to have a mustache. One of his hands is raised in front of the left side of his face. He may rest his head on his raised hand, as his head is bent forward slightly. The second male figure from left is probably Bildad.  He has short curly hair and a beard and sits facing forward and right. Most of his body is obscured by the figure sitting in front of him, though he may wear a gown. He appears to bend forward and to the right slightly. The leftmost figure is probably Eliphaz.  He is gowned, or wears a shirt and cloak, and sits facing right with his knees bent beneath him and upper body bent or hunched forward.  He is old and has long hair and a beard. His right arm is at his side but bent upward, perhaps to rest on his left forearm. He points to the right with his right index finger, which appears to be extended through his beard.  His left arm is also bent and may rest in his lap. The ground on which the five figures sit may be covered in straw or other long grass. Behind the group of five figures, at least five tree trunks are visible. The third trunk from the left has a single bifurcated branch that extends to the left. The sky visible in the background is dark and pierced by at least one bolt of lightning between the third and fourth trunks from the right. There may be other, smaller bolts between the first tree on the left and the second and between the second and third tree from the right.</illusobjdesc>

Both arms are slightly bent and at his sides with palms facing up and forward, fingers spread.  His knees are bent upward toward his chest. This figure is likely Job.</illusobjdesc>
