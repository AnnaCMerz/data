                        flies or hovers in a horizontal position. His right arm is extended, finger
                        pointed, and left leg bent downward. A cloud may support this figure or,
                        alternatively, drapery from his clothing may surround him. There may be an

                        <illusobjdesc>A male figure with long hair, the personified Cloud of *The
                            Book of Thel*, flies or hovers in a horizontal position in the upper
                            right quadrant of the composition. His right arm is extended, finger
                            pointed, and left leg bent downward behind an extended right leg. His
                            body faces forward, but he turns his head down and to the left, likely
                            to look at the standing figure below. He may be nude or lightly draped
                            in some sort of flowing gown. A cloud may support this figure or,
                            alternatively, drapery may surround him.</illusobjdesc>
