<updatestmt>
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> Copy U, from Princeton University Library, and Copy W, from King’s College, Cambridge University. Both are late copies and join Copies A, B, C, E, F, L, N, R, T, V, Y, Z, and AA, already available in the Archive.
<lb/>      
            <lb/> 
    <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy U was printed in orange ink, given orange frame lines and page numbers, and finished in watercolors and pen and ink. It was produced in the same style on the same Ruse &amp; Turner paper as <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy T, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copies O, N, and P, <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copies N and O, and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy D. This set of illuminated books&mdash;which, with the exception of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy N, are in the Archive&mdash;was produced in 1818 and represents Blake’s return to illuminated printing. Except for a few copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> between 1802 and 1811, Blake had not printed an illuminated book&mdash;or a group of them together&mdash;since 1795. 
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
    These late copies of illuminated books are often referred to as “elaborately colored,” but that fails to do them justice. The pages do not resemble lightly washed manuscripts or drawings, like the first copies (1789-93), or oil sketches, like color printed copies or books of designs (1794-96); nor do they resemble the hand-colored large paper copies of 1795. The pages are highly finished watercolor drawings. Blake printed the full plate (no wiping of borders) in bright reddish or orangish ink, finished the impressions in transparent and translucent washes and stippling brushwork, and carefully outlined texts and figures in pen and ink. The attention to detail was sustained throughout, and the designs often contain shell gold and were given a single thin red line or floral border to frame the image and thereby emphasize their autonomy as paintings in watercolor. 
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
    The renewal of Blake’s vigorous commitment to the illuminated books is evident in the ornate, beautifully colored impressions of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy W, printed in 1825 on large sheets of J Whatman 1825 paper (approximately 28 x 22 cm.) that give the small plates (approximately 11.5 x 7 cm.) wide margins that serve to frame the images. The untrimmed sheets for objects 1, 3, and 42 are shown as supplementary images. As in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy Y, its companion copy, each of the designs in Copy W is decoratively framed with vines, curtains, and other motifs drawn in green watercolor, probably by Catherine Blake, who described the copy as being “especially precious from having been ‘Blake’s own’” (Alexander Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> [1863], 1:365). She sold it for £10.10 to John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick, in 1830. Like Copy U, the plates of Copy W are ordered 1 through 54, as they are in seven of the last eight copies printed (Copy V is the exception). Blake based this plate order&mdash;now considered standard for all print editions&mdash;with slight variations on <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy R, printed in 1795 and his personal copy until he refinished it in 1819 for John Linnell, his new patron (see the 14 December 1999 Update for <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy R). 
        <lb/>

They seem to represent Adam and Eve being driven from the paradise in Eden.  Eve, the long-haired lower figure, bends almost to a prone position, as if she has been crawling on the ground.  Her head is turned toward the viewer.  Her right leg is drawn up under her and her left is extended behind.  Her visible arm is extended beyond her head on the ground.  Adam's body is bent over hers.  His legs are spread and he clasps his head in his arms.  The two bent bodies and the flames form concentric arches.  Although the flames rise to the top right corner of the plate, the text of the title and subtitle begins in the area of sky that is visible at upper left; the title descends line by line into their midst, ending just over Adam and Eve's arched bodies.  An ascending bird spreads its wings in the area to the right of the first "Of" (line 3).  The initial "S," the "N," and the final "S" of "SONGS" (line 2) have extravagant vine-like extensions.  Dark wash that may represent shadow stretches across the bottom of the plate; it is widest at the bottom left corner and grows narrower as it extends toward the bottom right corner.</illusobjdesc>

The child on the left may be a boy with short, curly hair; the gowned child on the right, with long hair, is probably a girl.  To the right of the group is a large apple(?) tree bearing fruit; around the trunk loosely spirals a vine.  The upper leaves of the tree are integrated with the letters of "SONGS" (line 2).  There may be the suggestion of a second tree on the horizon in the background just to the right of the tree in the foreground.  Various small figures can be seen among the letters of the title.  Birds fly in the sky beneath and to the left of the "S" and above the "N" in "SONGS."  Another bird flies upward above the first "n" of "Innocence" (line 4).  The band of color at the bottom of the plate suggests a river.  Coloring in the lower portions of the sky suggest a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

A river flows across the bottom of the plate.

grazing flock of sheep.  He holds a crook in his left hand; his shepherd's purse, or wallet, is visible 
near his right knee.  In the foreground, one of the sheep looks forward, and beside it another 
sheep lifts its head up, as if looking back at the shepherd.  There is a ram just to the left of the 
shepherd's lower right leg.  Up the right margin beside the shepherd is a leafy tree encircled by a vine with
lily-like blossoms 
near the bottom. The tree's longest branch extends almost to the left margin.  There are more
trees 
and a hilltop in the background, where the sky suggests that the time is sunrise or sunset.  On the 
left a single bird with broad wings and long tail feathers ascends in the light.  Three smaller birds 
soar to the right of the large bird, while two others perch on the branch just below.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A group of four adults (the text mentions "old folk" and "mothers" on object 6, line 16 and object 7, line 12, respectively), including two long-haired(?) males wearing brimmed hats and two females—one wearing a scarf over her head (center), the other a cap (right)—sit presumably on a circular bench at the base of the trunk of a large oak tree.  They superintend four young children who stand at their knees.  Behind them five older children play and stroll on a grassy area.  The dense, umbrella-shaped canopy of the central tree spreads over the entire scene from margin to margin.  Other, much smaller, trees or bushes line the background.  Rosy wash behind this background vegetation suggests a sunrise or sunset, and portions of dark blue sky are visible at the top left and top right corners.  The tree casts a shadow on the lower right of the design, which may suggest "the darkening Green" of line 17 on the following object.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Against a background hinting, by the darkness on the lower right, at twilight on the "darkening Green" (line 17), a procession of nine adults and children (including one infant) in a variety of positions moves generally leftward.  Overhead in the branches of two luxuriant, intertwining grape vines that are rooted at lower right and grow upward along the right margin and left to embrace the stanzas of the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster of grapes on the left while a second boy, right, hands another cluster to a girl who reaches up from the grass below.  Next to her, walking left, is a long-haired male in hat and tights or breeches; with his left hand he holds out a cluster of grapes toward a small boy in front of him while, between them, a woman looks down at the infant in her arms.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps "Old John with white hair," (object 6, line 13) points forward with his right hand and with his other hand reaches down toward the boy to the left.  That boy, who faces away from the viewer, holds a bat at his side with his left hand.  At the front of the procession are a boy and girl, both looking back toward the rest of the group.  Between them is a kite that the girl may be holding.  A strip of dark blue streaked with grey, perhaps a river, extends across the bottom margin of the illustration.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>In a grassy landscape, a nude boy with short, curly hair stands in contrapposto in front of a flock of sheep—some grazing, some standing, some lying down.  The boy reaches out to touch(?) the nose of one of them—perhaps the "Little Lamb" of the text—with his hands.  Behind the flock are a leafy oak tree with a large trunk (left) and a cottage or barn (right) with an open doorway.  On its thatched(?) roof perch two birds, often identified as doves.  Two slender trees, one on each side, frame the plate.  Both trees are intertwined with vines that sprout several loopy tendrils.  Where the tree branches meet and intertwine at the top, creating an arch between the title and the text of the poem, they are leafy.  Vines or branches grow across the plate near its midpoint to help fill the space between the two stanzas.  A river runs across the bottom of the plate.  The sky is lightly colored to extend across the entire upper area of the plate, integrating the text into the design.  A dark blue area at the top left, and an especially dark area directly above the cottage on the right, may be dark clouds or darkening sky, suggesting sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>At dawn, an adult female, nude above the waist, with a skirt or other drapery on her lap, sits facing a kneeling(?) child who points upward with his left hand.  With her right hand she reaches across her lap toward the boy.  Presumably they correspond to the "mother" (lines 3, 7) and "Little Black Boy" (title [line 2]) of the text.  They are both dark of skin.  The pair sits under the canopy of a leafy tree whose trunk grows up the left margin behind the mother.  A twining vine wraps twice around the tree trunk, its top loop protruding as a half-circle on the trunk’s right side.  A second, smaller tree grows up the right margin and arches over the sun&#8212;a pattern echoed on the next object.  The hilly plain that stretches to the treeless horizon seems to be covered with grass.  A distant mountain may be visible on the right.  "The rising sun" of the text (line 11) mounts above the horizon.  The sun's beams show distinctly against the clouds and contrast with the dark landscape.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The elements of the design combine and develop a selection of those on the previous object.  Christ, in conventional representation as a shepherd, with beard, gown, halo (that doubles as the sun, echoing the previous object), and crook, sits facing left on a grassy bank.  Two nude boys&#8212;the left dark-skinned, the right light-skinned in this copy&#8212;stand in front of him.  One, probably the "little English boy" (line 7) whom the little black boy addresses in the final two stanzas of the poem, stands at Jesus's knee, holds his hands in a praying gesture, and looks up at Jesus, who looks down at him.  The other boy, probably the little black boy from the previous object, stands behind the little English boy with his right hand out toward him to "stroke his silver hair" (line 12).  All three are sheltered under a leafy, willow-like tree that forms a tight arch over their heads.  Its roots are partially exposed on the grassy bank to the right.  A flock of sheep grazes to the left of the left-most boy, and a river runs at the foot of the plate.  The left and top margins of the plate are colored to suggest that the sky continues above the lower design to the top.  A vine rooted in the bank to the right of the tree grows up the right margin, and similar vegetation extends from the tree to complete the circuit around the top and left side of the text.  Another vine with intertwined branches rooted in the riverbank in the plate’s bottom left corner grows about a quarter of the way up the left margin; it may bear leaves or flowers.  The willow-like tree is backed by leafy plants or trees.</illusobjdesc>

In its upper reaches there is a circle of eight figures (clockwise from the far right): (1) a nude infant or child flying or running with its arms raised vertically; (2) a winged figure, probably female, in a gown, with the suggestion of a halo to the right of her head, sitting on part of the blossom just above the "som" of "Blossom" in the title; (3) she holds an infant in her arms (ill-defined and so barely visible in this copy but clearer in others); (4) to her left, a winged figure, nude(?), kneeling or sitting, facing left, and possibly reading or writing in a book or on a tablet; (5 and 6) far left, two winged figures who fly facing one another (one facing away from and the other facing toward the viewer); (7 and 8) and a second pair of winged nude figures, kneeling and facing one another, embracing and kissing(?).  All the figures probably represent, in some fashion, the birds and blossoms that are the subjects of the poem; if so, the central lower pair (2 and 3 above) may be the female blossom who addresses the sparrow and robin in the text.  The blue background suggests the sky, with a darker area of blue wash behind and above the figures indicating that the time is just before dawn or just after dusk, and there is a narrow strip of grass at bottom.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The illustration seems to depict chimney sweeper Tom Dacre's dream of liberation for himself and his fellow sweeps by an angel, who releases them from their "coffins of black" to run "naked" down a "green plain" and "wash in a river" (lines 14-18).  Below a background of sky are several small figures and leafy plants or a hedge.  At bottom right a gowned adult bends forward, reaching toward a tiny nude figure emerging from the earth or one of the coffins of the text.  Across the rest of the bottom of the plate are nude figures standing or running with their arms raised in various positions.  Two pairs are embracing.  The uncolored area at lower left suggests the river that the liberated boys wash themselves in.  Behind the gowned adult a tree that grows up the right margin helps to tie the elements of the plate into a single design, as does the sky behind the text.</illusobjdesc>

rather barren (but perhaps grassy) ground, toward the viewer.  The child raises his right arm to hold the 
adult's arm.  The adult has a lighted ring around his head that suggests a halo; the child appears to 
wear a hat, which also might suggest a halo.  The text describes the

If this is God, it is very probably Christ, given the similarities between this figure and several of Blake's other representations of Christ.  His halo exudes several spiky beams of dark radiance, the lower of which tend to merge with the dark background.  Both feet are exposed; his left foot is forward.

                    <illusobjdesc>Eight figures gather around a table that sits on grass against a wall of green 
vegetation bordered by sky across the top.  Five figures&#8212;one of which, second from left, is somewhat difficult to discern&#8212;sit behind the table,
away 
from the viewer; the female at far right extends her arm to hold a drinking glass that rests on the 
table.  Near the ends of the table on the front side, two other figures sit in chairs that are turned 
sideways, facing one another.  Each figure holds a glass on the table.  Between them stands an eighth 
figure, a male in tights.  In upraised hands he holds a glass 
(right) and a plumed hat (left).  The faces of all but one of the figures on the far side of the table are visible.  The figure on the near side of the table on the left and the central standing figure face away from the viewer; the figure on the right faces to the left. 
The 
text mentions "green woods," "meadows," and a "table" in "the shade" (lines 3, 7, 11-12).  The 
suggestion of a shady refuge is reinforced by the border of sky and by the shadows(?) on the ground.</illusobjdesc>

the title, to the left a bird with outspread wings ascends vertically; another glides over "Song" (line 2);
and at the right a third dives.  In the right margin, after "shade" (line 11), a tiny bird ascends
steeply, with what may be two other birds beside it.  
Across the bottom of the plate are seven others (left to right): two flying above the vine, with 
outspread wings and forked tails, the right one ascending; below the vine a third, descending; a 
fourth, with forked tail, perching on the vine; to its right, above the vine a fifth bird flying, and 
below the vine, a sixth ascending and, finally, a seventh perching with wings raised.</illusobjdesc>

The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of the 
right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title, and
down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
another. 
But the vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title
and fills the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 2) contribute to both 
forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the 
poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of stray 
decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>From a sitting position in a curved-back chair, a female nurse or mother dressed in a high-waisted gown and cap or headdress of some sort leans over a swaddled infant who sleeps in a hooded wicker cradle that stands on rockers.  Her arms may be folded across her chest, perhaps in an attitude of prayer.  The infant's pillow suggests a halo, and the speaker of the poem proposes an identification of the infant with Christ (object 16, stanza 6; object 17, stanzas 1-2): "Infant smiles are his own smiles" (line 8).  The cradle extends to the left of the chair.  A carpet with an intricate pattern covers the floor, and dark fabric hung between vertical uprights creates a curtain-like screen in the background.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Against a sky-colored background a serpentine plant-like structure with brilliant flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in a small strip of grassy(?) ground, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up the left margin.  Between stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the left margin and ends under the title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and fourth stanzas and crosses into the right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward flourish at top left.  The large plant is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted, like the plant itself, at the bottom right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the standing figure and then, after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which the vine continues to climb until it terminates just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure.  There are several human figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long hair walks right; a second gowned female with long hair floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side, facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned, haloed, Christ-like figure stands, with an arm extended, touching the left hand of a nude male figure to the left, who reclines with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically; below and in front of this pair, a third figure, a nude female, reclines, supported on her left arm.  Yellow wash at the top left corner (the border of which is marked by the floating female), rosy wash at the top right, and darker blue wash along the left and right margins suggest sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The large plant is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted, like the plant itself, at the bottom right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the standing figure and then, after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant (sending out occasional tendrils to the left, into the spaces left by short lines of the poem) until it terminates in a cluster of leaves that dangles just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Nine pairs of uniformed boys in coats and caps walk to the right across the top of the plate.  The precise positions of the children are not always clear.  Some of the boys may be holding one another.  They are led by a pair of gowned adults, both with hats, and each carrying a staff or scepter.  At the bottom of the plate a similar procession occurs, though with seven pairs of girls instead of nine of boys, walking left instead of right, and led by a single female(?) figure who is holding a what may be a book.  Directly below this book-like object is an indeterminate, green and roughly conical object that may be a small plant, perhaps part of a hedge.  The girls wear dresses with aprons.  The figures altogether represent the charity children of the text, "walking two &amp; two" behind the "Grey headed beadles" who "walkd before with wands" into St. Paul's cathedral "on a Holy Thursday" (lines 3-6).  Each boy wears a green, blue, or rosy uniform, and each girl wears a white, blue, or green dress.  Together, the girls cast a strip of shadow on the ground below them.  The brown tint to this ground beneath the girls suggests grassless earth.  Yellow and blue wash behind the procession of girls, and blue and rosy wash behind the procession of boys, suggest a sky at sunrise or sunset.  Tall brown objects that may be tree trunks form the left and right borders of the girls’ illustration, casting additional shadows along the bottom margin and terminating when they reach the text area.</illusobjdesc>

Many of the letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like extensions.

                    <illusobjdesc>A slender tree with leafy branches grows up the right margin, bends under and around the left end of the title—whose lettering harmonizes with the surrounding foliage—and curves back over it.  A second tree, much smaller, is rooted at the top of a hill or mound near the bottom right margin; its branches cross behind the larger tree above the angel opposite "nest" in line 19.  A second branch of the larger tree continues up the right side of the plate and terminates in the top right corner.  Several leafy branches extend left into the spaces left by short lines of the poem.  The tree is loosely encircled by a leafy vine whose termination, perhaps where the tree bends left, is unclear.  The tree is rooted at bottom right between a river in the foreground and a cave where a lion lies.  There are winged angelic figures in the tree, one standing with wings outspread at top right, a second sitting with wings folded on a branch beneath the first, and a third flying (or standing on one leg) just above the lion's den.  Two birds perch on a branch right of line 6.  There is a small star near the right margin, below and to the right of the vine’s bottommost leaf.  In the left margin are other figures and objects (bottom to top): a gowned figure, standing on the ground and facing forward; just above that, a hovering figure; another, arms raised vertically, either hovering or standing on a curved marking that may indicate a sphere (the sun or moon?); just above that another, with wings and arms outspread.  All the figures may be the angels described in the text (object 20, line 14; object 21, line 7).  Above the top figure on the left, beside line 6, is another sphere (the sun or moon?); scattered across this same space in the left margin are four stars and six dots that may also be stars.  The sky and the earth are dark in places, with lighter areas behind the title and text area; the coloring and stars suggest night.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The text of the poem appears to be etched in a sky-colored area that has been opened for the purpose over the branches of a large tree whose trunk, entwined by a leafy vine, grows up the left margin, while its long, leafy branches extend above and behind (as it were) the text well into the right margin.  Beyond the tips of the branches is a vertical strip of night sky with four large stars.  On the ground, between a backdrop of trees or other vegetation and a river that runs across the foreground, five gowned female(?) figures stand in two groups.  To the right, just under the branches, one female faces left and points or gestures left with her upraised left arm as she turns to look at her companion, who faces forward but looks left toward her companion.  To the left, close to the tree trunk, stand three other females.  The left-most figure has her arms crossed and looks right; the one in the middle, who seems to have long hair, looks forward; the one to the right looks left.  The upper bodies of the figures in both groups are lit from behind, perhaps to suggest haloes and thus the angels mentioned in the text (object 20, line 14; object 21, line 7).  One of the lights, more probably the one behind the two figures to the right, may be the moon.

                    <illusobjdesc>A nude infant with curly hair and halo reclines on a strip of grass behind a river that runs across the foreground.  With both hands the infant touches a lamb to the left, and the two of them look at one another.  Two sheep also lie on the ground, left and right of the infant.  The infant may be the one who speaks to the "Little Lamb" in the final stanza of the poem (line 9).  The background, colored to suggest the sky at sunrise or sunset, and perhaps with clouds behind the second stanza, helps to integrate the plate into a single design, though the decorative elements in the margins are typical of Blake's interlinear designs (and similar to those on the previous object, where they are divided from the top design).  Vine-like extensions of the "L's" in the initial words (lines 2, 9) of the two stanzas on this plate dangle, with loops and leaves, in the left margin, and the lower extension divides into tendrils that wrap almost completely around the vignette at bottom—even across the surface of the water.  This lower extension sprouts an additional tendril left of line 10, and this tendril forks left of line 13.  Two clusters of similar vegetation fill the spaces left in the right margin by the short lines of the poem.  The lower one originates at the end of line 9; the upper one extends leftward from the upper right margin and may be connected to a strip of spiky green vegetation that runs from this cluster’s point of origin to the top right corner.  There is a figure associated with each cluster of vegetation in the right margin: below, a gowned angel with large wings sitting on a curve of the plant with her(?) knees drawn up and her head down; above, a gowned figure standing, with arms outspread, in a semi-circle made by the plant.  There are grain tassels at the right side of the lower vignette, to the right of lines 13-15, below the end of line 8, and to the right of lines 3-4.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Beneath the text and dense interlinear vegetation comprising most of the plate, seven children&#8212;four boys and two, probably three, girls&#8212;hold hands and play, or perhaps dance, in an incomplete circle under the limb of a tree with a few leaves.  The two children furthest left stretch something, perhaps a piece of cloth, between them.  A matron-figure in cap and gown, evidently the nurse of the title, sits on the ground against the trunk and reads a book in her lap.  The tree has two major branches: the right branch extends straight to the right (above the nurse and children), and the left branch extends up the left margin to the top of the illustration, sprouting a loopy vine beside the last stanza that extends upward, wraps around the first stanza, and apparently merges with the embellishments surrounding the title.  This latter branch may also sprout more of these embellishments, left of the title.  These two branches and the vine partially frame the text area.  To the right is a second tree, slimmer and more obviously leafy, with a vine around its lower trunk.  There are "hills" (line 14) in the background and shadows across the foreground.  In front of the shadows, a river runs along the bottom margin.  The sky above the hills on the left and behind the text area is colored to suggest a sky at sunset (as indicated by line 7).</illusobjdesc>

                            stretch something, perhaps a piece of cloth used in a game, between them; a girl raises her arms horizontally and faces right with legs outspread; a boy raises his arms 
                            higher, as does the long-haired girl to the right of him, whose leg is extended behind her; holding 
                            her hand, a boy runs left and reaches forward to hold the hand of another running or striding boy, 
                            left leg extended behind him, who raises his free left hand as he moves left and back, perhaps 
                            toward the opening between the pair furthest left.  All the girls have on gowns; all the boys wear 
                            tight-fitting garments.  These are the "little ones" who "leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'd" (line 17) and 
                            remonstrate with the nurse in the poem.</illusobjdesc>

This latter branch may also sprout more of these embellishments, left of the title.  These two branches and the vine partially frame the text area.  On the right is a second tree, slimmer, with more leafy branches visible and a vine climbing up its trunk.  Between the trees is "the green" of line 3.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Rooted on a grassy mound at the bottom right of the plate, a leafy, blooming plant with two major stems embraces the text of the poem above.  The lesser stem, which culminates in a closed blossom or unopened bud, grows in an s-curve up the right margin.  The greater stem curves left—between the grass and the text—and then up the left margin.  It culminates in a large and lavish blossom whose flame-like petals open into the space above the text.  Within the blossom, in place of stamens and pistils, are three figures.  At left, a long-haired, gowned female with the suggestion of a halo sits holding an infant.  Facing right, she looks down at it as she rests her right arm across it.  To the right, facing them, stands a winged and gowned female angel who looks down at the infant and holds her hands out toward it.  Each of her wings is marked with a dot, and around her head is the suggestion of a halo.  The infant and seated mother(?) may be identified with the two speakers of the poem; there, the infant names itself "Joy" (line 7).  A third stem of the plant, with no blossom, grows across the bottom of the plate alongside the major stem; in the left margin yet another stem sprouts from the main one.  In the background is a vast expanse of sky with yellow, rosy, and blue areas that suggest a sunrise or (less likely) sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The coloring of the sky and the presence of several stars in the top margin place the scene at night, as implied in the poem.  The lighter coloring behind the text suggests clouds.  Several varieties of vegetation fill spaces around the text and between stanzas.  The stanzas are separated by irregular vine-like structures that are sometimes extensions of letters (such as the "I" at the beginning of line 19) or extensions of other vegetation (as between stanzas 4 and 5) or, sometimes, discrete bits.  The initial "A" in the title (line 2) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like extension dangles down the left margin.  The vegetation in the upper right margin&#8212;beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title&#8212;seems to be an arc of tasseled grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it&#8212;opposite stanzas 1 and 2&#8212;are three or four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line 11) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin&#8212;opposite stanzas 4 and 5&#8212;is an odd tree(?) rooted in the strip of ground that begins in the illustration’s bottom right corner and, under “home” (line 22).  In front of the tree stands a robed figure, wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form.  He is one of four small and indistinct human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, probably reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny and indistinct (or questionable) forms in the margins: there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) on the vegetation beneath "her" in line 10, and another ant or beetle to the right of line 5; a winged beetle(?) (lines 20-21) flying right of line 19; and a glow-worm (line 16) at the edge of the design after line 6.  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line 3.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A lithe and leafy tree, rooted bottom right in the strip of ground that extends across the bottom edge of the design, grows up the right edge.  A vine grows up around its trunk; grape clusters are visible opposite stanzas 6 and 7; at the midway point the vine seems to produce the loopy tendril that terminates near the bird with long tail feathers that ascends to the right of stanza 6.  Other birds fly to the right of lines 4 (although the coloring in this copy integrates it with adjacent leaves), 7, and 13.  Two or three more birds, also rendered ambiguous by their coloring, may perch on the branch beside line 6.  The letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of "Anothers," which is decorated with a kind of forked top above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final "w," are the most notable (line 2).  A yellow sky provides the background along the top half of the right margin and across the top of the plate; blue sky provides the background for the left margin and lower half of the right margin; the area behind the text is also yellow, with rosy streaks that suggest clouds at sunrise or sunset.  Against the sky on the left is a lattice of bare branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  There are very loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part of the tree.  At the base of the trees in the left margin, a figure playing a pipe stands against the right tree; at the piper's feet is an indistinct shape (possibly a dog in other copies).

grape 
clusters are visible opposite stanzas 6 and 7; at the midway point the vine seems to produce the 
loopy tendril that terminates near stanza 6.  The letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of "Anothers," which is 
decorated with a kind of forked top above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final 
"w," are the most notable.  In the left margin is a lattice of bare branches from two thin trees rooted at 
bottom left.  There are very loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine 
or part of the tree.</illusobjdesc>

Given the setting and the position of the plate in sequence, he is probably the shepherd-piper of the frontispiece to *Innocence*, but he has no pipe.  Sitting on his head (or held in front of it), legs dangling either side of his face, is a cherubic, winged angel who is nude, with short hair, and presumably male.  The two hold each other's hands.  Both figures look straight at the viewer.  The environment is pastoral.  There are grassy fields in front with hills in the background; sheep graze behind the two figures.  A large tree dominates the right side of the design; its leafy branches arch across the top.  A short, leafy vine or ivy grows in front of this tree.  A second tree behind the sheep on the left helps frame the design.  The treatment of the sky suggests sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>In a composition dominated by strict verticals and horizontals, a young short-haired male (behind) and young gowned female (in front) with her hair pulled back in a bun bend over two dead(?) bodies, an old, bearded, gowned male (in front) and a gowned female, possibly wearing a cap of some sort (behind), who are laid out on a draped table (possibly a bier) that extends from the left to right edge of the design.  The two mourners are seen in profile facing left, their heads looking down toward the bodies, and holding their hands to their heads in gestures of distress, perhaps crying or in prayer.  The corpses are arranged with their heads resting on pillows at left.  The visible (right) arm of the male is at his side.  Because of their lack of color, the two might be taken for tomb effigies.  In the background is a paneled wall or partition flanked by pilasters—a cemetery wall, tomb, or church interior; on the right pilaster appears the ostensible date of publication, "1794" (line 5).  Shadows fall toward the left on each pilaster and, on the right, onto the legs of the supine bodies, the gowned female, and the ground right of her feet.  Above the background structure, in a space colored to suggest sky at sunrise or sunset, is the title, with its first and third words in block letters.  In a rectangle (suggestive of a grave?) below the feet of the mourning female is more publication information.  Along the right margin and in the top right corner are what may be curtains or, more likely in light of the branches, parts of trees.  Taken together, the bottom rectangle and the tree-like border along the right margin suggest that the scene is set out of doors, perhaps at graveside.</illusobjdesc>

are seen in profile facing left, holding their heads down and holding their hands to their faces in 
gestures of distress, perhaps crying (though no tears are visible) or praying.  The female stands with her 
weight on her right leg, her left leg extended behind.  They may be the children of the dead couple.</illusobjdesc>

a 
cluster of flowers or tendrils with leaves that extend across the first three letters; from the bottom 
of the "S" another tendril, with one loop, terminates in a flower or large leaf.  An extension from the
top of the "G" divides left into leafy branches, to the right into a pair of flowers or leaves.  The
top of 
the final "S" sends out a tendril with many small loops that curves right and down below the letter toward the head of the floating figure.  The "of" (line 3) has two extensions with several branches 
and leaves, probably ivy.  Three human figures are associated with the text of the title.  Standing 
on an extension at the bottom of the initial "S" is a gowned figure with arm raised.  Two figures 
flank "of": to the left (facing right) hovers a gowned female with long hair that streams behind her 
in a kind of tail, her arm extended, and to the right (facing left) hovers a short-haired male, nude or wearing tights, his left arm raised and his left leg extended backward, as if leaping in mid-air.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A trunk-like border, probably a tree rooted in the grassy ground at the bottom left corner, extends up the left margin, continues across the top margin, and descends in the right margin to fade into the ground at the bottom right corner.  The border’s jagged edges in the right margin suggest leaves, or perhaps imply that other vegetation has replaced the tree.  To the right of the left marginal border is a leafy vine that frames the text area on its left and top sides, wraps around the right of lines 2-5, and terminates in the space following the short lines 5 and 6.  This vine appears to be an extension of the serpent’s tail at the bottom left corner of the plate, though the two are probably distinct.  Independent vines or branches decorate the top right corner of the plate and separate all of the stanzas.  A vine with a loop grows from the initial letter in line 7; one of its branches descends left of the second stanza, while the other grows horizontally between the first and second stanzas.  Another, possibly growing from the "f" of "of" in line 12, bears leaves and a large cluster of grapes right of line 12 before extending upward and to the left, completing the divide between the first two stanzas.  Another vine, possibly growing from the top of the initial "S" in line 13, separates the second and third stanzas.  One of this vine’s tendrils grows leftward and down the left margin; the other descends in serpentine leaves through the right margin of and into the spaces between the third, fourth, and fifth stanzas.  Across the bottom an open-mouthed serpent crawls to the right across the grass.  The text appears over a large expanse of rosy, golden, and possibly cloudy sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

A gowned female, presumably the mother, is seated with at least one leg drawn up as she holds in her lap a nude child who clings to her shoulder.  A second child stands facing them at the left, his head down in his visible hand.  Below this group, in the lower right corner, is the nude corpse of another child(?).  All the figures are positioned on beds of lush, green vegetation, perhaps giant leaves.  There is a bit of spiky vegetation above the dead child at lower right.  Left of the text area is a vine that branches off to underline the title and separate stanzas 1 and 2.  Left of the title, a prominent leaf or bloom grows from the vine that descends left of the text area.  Three similar leaves or flowers sprout on the segment of the vine that separates the title from the first stanza.  In the left margin, a tree or vine grows from the ground in the bottom left corner and extends upward, forming a border, until it fades into the top half’s illustration.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The illustration is integrated into a full-plate design by virtue of the single strip of ground below and the washes for the sky.  The colors of the sky suggest sunset, appropriate to the approach of night recorded in the text, with a dark cloud behind the figures lower right.  The design is focused on two human figures standing in an embrace under the arching branches of a tall, slender, vine-entwined willow-like tree in the right margin.  A female in a semi-transparent gown looks right as she points upward with her left arm and with her right arm embraces a young male.  Her one visible eye is open.  He embraces her with both arms.  At her feet is a mound of vegetation—apparently a plant with one leaf visible, perhaps an anemone pulsatilla.  To the left of the treetop a bird—with a long forked tail and wings spread—ascends.  A border of indeterminate vegetation runs up the top half of the right margin and extends leftward across the right half of the top margin.  (The prominent but structurally independent[?] vine that fills the left margin is classified here as interlinear decoration.)</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Rooted at bottom left, a rose bush with leaves and prominent thorns surrounds the text.  Along the stems that arch over the poem are two gowned females who seem to represent roses that are dying blossoms or blighted buds—in any case, roses whose lives are destroyed by the "dark secret love" of the "invisible worm" (lines 9, 4).  One kneels in a severely contracted position while the other lies with her arms wrapped around her lowered head, her gown trailing down along the stem below her.  Above them to the left is an S-shaped caterpillar with the lower part of his body on the stem and the upper part resting on a leaf that he may be eating.  Below the poem is a globular rose blossom, dense with petals and near its prime.  In its opening, to the left, appears the tail end of a worm and, just behind it—perhaps held by it—is a gowned(?) female with her arms raised.  The background is washed to suggest the sky.  The left and lower right edges of the plate suggest a border of indeterminate vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

The nurse holds the child's raised arms, apparently helping it learn to walk.  Behind them to the left stands a long-haired gowned young female hitting a shuttlecock with a badminton racquet.  Sky and clouds, colored to suggest sunrise or sunset, are visible above the hill in the background.  The nurse and the child on the left seem to be framed by the yellow-tinted cloud(s) behind them.

The "maiden Queen" (line 4) of the poem reclines, resting her head on her right hand as she reaches up and back with her left, pushing (perhaps also holding) the face of the male "Angel mild" (line 5), apparently fending off his advances ("I was arm'd, he came in vain," line 16).  His right arm lies along her left as his left hand reaches across his body to touch her left arm.  He is nude, with the suggestion of genitals, and has short hair, and large wings; she is gowned, has long hair, and is crowned.  From the tree above, the loops of a leafless vine rise between the two figures.  There is a hedge or hill behind them.  The sky is blue with a rosy tint on the left, behind the tree, suggesting sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

Her posture suggests melancholy.  She is gowned, has long hair, and is crowned.  She may be wearing a belt.  With her head at the left at the base of the tree, she faces forward and looks out toward the left—away from the Angel.  Her left foot is visible and her mouth is slightly open as though she is speaking.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Of the three poems on the plate, only "My Pretty ROSE TREE" (line 2), at the top, has anything other than interlinear and marginal designs.  Beneath its text, beside a tree with leafless branches that occupies the right margin, are two figures.  At the base of the tree a gowned female with long hair reclines, the weight of her upper body apparently supported by her bent left arm.  She may be the pretty rose tree of the poem.  At her feet, facing right beside a plant or tuft of grass, is a second gowned figure, sitting (or perhaps kneeling) in a contracted position.  This may be the male who "tend[s]" the rose-tree "by day and by night" (line 8).  His right upper arm and left lower arm and hand are visible, and he seems to have his left hand tucked between his head and shoulder.  Pale rose and blue wash in the area behind the figures and text, growing darker toward the top left, suggests a cloudy sky, possibly at sunrise or sunset.  A flock of nine birds flies above the reclining female alongside one larger bird, soaring upward with outstretched wings, right of the male’s head.</illusobjdesc>

The two gowned children(?) on the left, probably male (left) and female (right), pray while the tonsured, gowned priest on the right looks toward a book in one hand as he gestures with the other toward the grave.  Behind the priest’s head is a golden halo.  A tombstone with ornate scrolled top stands before them at far right.  Behind and above them is what looks like an area of dark sky, or perhaps vegetation, with either a patch of sunlight or light cast by the halo just above the priest's head.  There is a window with diamond-shaped panes just above the tombstone, with a vine or branch growing beside it.  The window may be part of a church or the "Chapel . . . on the green" (lines 5-6).  On the left is a tree with a bare branch that extends over the figures.</illusobjdesc>

The child, looking back at the old man, reaches up toward him with his right hand and holds his left hand out and down, as if showing the way.  The location, judging from the poem, is a London street.  Cobblestones, of which the street is perhaps composed, are visible right of the child’s feet; they descend into the text area to the right of the title.

Together, the trees at left and right, the branch at top, and the river at bottom frame the entire plate.  The ground below may be grassy.</illusobjdesc>

Two large leafless(?) branches also arch over the figure lying on the ground.  A few small branches extend into the spaces of the right margin and between stanzas, most notably the branch between the title and the first stanza, which forks upward at the left end of the title and downward (resembling, perhaps, a vine more than a branch) along the left margin until it joins the "y" of "My" (line 18).  The curved form right of line 15 may be another branch of the tree, although not attached to it.</illusobjdesc>

Etched vertically on the old man's gown is "It is Raised a Spiritual Body" (derived from 1 Corinthians 15:44).

                  playing a game of marbles on an area of ground, the bank of a river(?) running along 
                  the bottom margin.  Behind the right-most figure is a bit of spiny vegetation and two large 
                  intertwining grapevines extending up the right margin to the top of the plate.  On the vines 
                  are four other children: (bottom to top) one—long-haired and thus 
perhaps a girl—standing with arms raised, two boys(?) climbing, and another boy(?) sitting and reading.  
In the left margin are a slender tree and a vine intertwined with it with a bird left of the first stanza. 
There would appear to be a figure standing in this vine, left of the fourth stanza.
The background is colored to suggest a cloudy(?) sky with light, possibly of sunrise or sunset, above 
the horizon.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned, bearded old man stands, playing a large harp, before an audience of perhaps two children—standing in the middle of the group—and six older youths.  He may be the bard of the title.  To the left stand two young females (the taller possibly male) who embrace.  To the right stand the 
two children and a group of three gowned females who face the bard.  At their feet, facing them, kneels another female.  All the figures appear to be gowned.  The scene is set outdoors on a strip of grassy and slightly inclined ground.  The sky behind and above the figures is delineated by a dark area behind them to 
the left, a lighter area to the right, and an area of gray and cloudy sky at the top.  Yellow tinting behind the harp and above the group of three standing figures hints at a sunrise or sunset.  A palm-like frond arches over the head of the figure at far right.</illusobjdesc>

Yellow tinting behind the harp and above the group of three standing figures hints at a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>
