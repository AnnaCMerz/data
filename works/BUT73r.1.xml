                    <illusobjdesc>A single figure stands facing forward in this lightly sketched composition.  Nude with relatively prominent genitals, the young male figure has short, flame-like hair standing on end and tilts his head up, creating a small shadow beneath his chin.  His mouth is slightly open and he may have a faint beard.  He raises both arms horizontally, palms out.  His fingers, which are noticeably long, are spread with thumbs pointing up.  Standing on his left leg, the figure raises his right leg at 45 degrees where his right foot appears to rest on an object (perhaps a stone or earthen mound?) defined by a single line in the lower left corner.  There are several faint horizontal lines in the lower right quadrant.  This figural sketch is a study for Blake's etching/engraving, "Albion rose."  The figure is not specifically identified as Albion until the inscription added to the plate c. 1820.</illusobjdesc>
