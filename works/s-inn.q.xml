<updatestmt>
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of digital editions of Blake's <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> Copy D from the Morgan Library and Museum, Copy O from the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Copy Q from Syracuse University Library, and Copy S from the Cincinnati Art Museum. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Blake first published <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> with thirty-one plates in 1789, the date on its title page. He appears to have printed twenty-three copies that year; three&#8212;possibly the first copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> printed&#8212;were in black ink on one side of the leaf, which remained uncolored (Copy U in the Archive is one of the three). Twenty were printed in green, yellow ochre, or raw sienna inks on both sides of octavo size leaves and finished in light watercolor washes. At least four of these were combined with copies of <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>, printed in 1794, to form <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (Copies B-E). For these newly combined copies, Blake moved Plates 34–36 (“The Little Girl Lost” and “The Little Girl Found”) to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi>, leaving <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> with twenty-eight plates. He moved Plates 53 (“The School Boy”) and 54 (“The Voice of the Ancient Bard”) to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> in 1818.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Copy D, printed in 1789 in yellow ochre (with four plates in light brown or raw sienna ink) on both sides of the leaves, has thirty-one plates and is finished in light washes. Copy O, printed c. 1802 in raw sienna ink on one side of the leaves, has twenty-six impressions finished in light washes, pen and ink outlining, and page numbers in the upper right corner of the designs. Plates 6 and 7 (“The Ecchoing Green”), numbered 5 and 6 in this copy, were extracted and are not extant. Copy Q, printed c. 1804 in light orangish yellow ochre ink on one side of the leaves, has twenty-eight plates and is finished in delicate washes, pen and ink outlining, and page numbers in pencil. The texts of Plates 17 and 19 (“A Cradle Song” and “Holy Thursday”) were lightly printed and entirely rewritten in pen and brown watercolor. The untrimmed leaves of Plates 2 and 5 (frontispiece and “The Shepherd”) in Copy Q are included as supplementary images to show how the plates were originally registered to the paper. Copy S, mostly printed c. 1811 in light black ink on one side of the leaves, has twenty-eight plates and is finished in light washes and pen and ink page numbers. Plate 2, the frontispiece printed in green ink, was added to Copy S between 1920 and 1922; Plates 3, 4, 12, and 27, printed in shades of brown ink, are also from earlier printings.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Of these four copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, only Copy D has ever been reproduced, by William Muir in a colored lithographic facsimile in 1885; the other copies have never been reproduced. With these copies, the Archive continues to realize its objective of publishing exemplary copies of each illuminated book from each of its printings and expanding the Blake canon by presenting works previously not available for study by the general public. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 132 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

                    <illusobjdesc>In the left and right margins vines or branches
intertwine to create eight indistinctly

one seated; (2) a running, leaping, nude figure; (3) a standing figure, looking
down at vegetation, possibly grain stems; (4) an indistinct
figure, possibly looking down at an infant in a cradle; (5) at top right, a
flying bird with vegetation, perhaps tree limbs and leaves above; (6) a seated figure facing the viewer with legs crossed, head resting on her(?) right hand, and perhaps holding an infant in her lap; (7) a solitary standing figure with three(?) flying birds; (8) two seated figures, probably gowned, facing to the right.  The overall structure has
sometimes been associated with 
depictions of the Tree of Jesse.  The vines send out tendrils that
arch over the top of the plate and 
fill space between stanzas.  Dark shadows surround the vines' outer edges in the lower left corner and extend along the border toward the center of the plate.  The background of the text is washed to suggest an area of sky and clouds along the top and side margins.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A group of four adults—the text mentions "old folk"
(Object 4, line 16) and "mothers" (Object 5, line 12)—including
two adults on the left, both wearing brimmed hats, and two
females wearing a scarf over her head (center) or a cap (right) sit
presumably on a circular bench at the base of the trunk of a large
oak tree.  They superintend five young children 
who stand at their knees or sit in their laps.  Behind them five older children play and
stroll on a grassy area.  The 
dense, umbrella-shaped canopy of the central tree spreads over the
entire scene.  Other trees or bushes fill the background, and a patch of blue sky peeks through the foliage at right.  The shadows
along the lower edge of the design
suggest that the time is late afternoon or early evening ("the
darkening Green" of line 17 on the 
following Object).</illusobjdesc>

the final "n" sends out buds and blossoms that surround the head of
the boy beneath.  A bird with outspread wings and forked tail flies

                    <illusobjdesc>Against a background colored to suggest
                        twilight on the "darkening Green" (line
                        17), a procession of nine adults and children (including one
                        infant) in a variety of positions moves 
                        generally leftward.  Overhead in the branches of two intertwining
                        grape vines that are rooted at lower right and grow upward along
                        the right margin and left to embrace the stanzas of
                        the poem, one boy, left, stretches on tiptoe to reach a cluster of
                        grapes on the left while a second boy, 
                        right, hands another cluster to a girl who reaches up from the
                        grass below.  Next to her, walking 
                        left, is a long-haired male in hat and tights; he holds a bunch of
                        grapes in his extended left hand.  Next in line is a woman who
                        looks down at the infant in her arms.  A small child stands just to
                        the left.  In the center, the tallest figure in the group, perhaps
                        "Old John with white hair" (line 12, Object 4), points forward with
                        his right hand.  A boy to the left, who faces away from the viewer,
                        holds a bat at his side with his left hand.  At the front of the
                        procession are a boy and girl, both looking back toward the rest of
                        the group.  Between them is a kite that the girl may be holding. 
                        The green tinting of the ground below the playful procession
                        suggests grass.</illusobjdesc>

                        leafy, blooming plant with two major stems embraces the text of the
                        poem above.  The lesser stem, which culminates in a closed blossom
                        or unopened bud, grows in an s-curve up the right margin.  The
                        greater stem curves left and then up the left margin.  It 
                        culminates in a large and lavish blossom whose flame-like petals
                        open into the space above the text.  Within the blossom, in place
                        of stamens and pistils, are three figures.  At left, a long-haired,
                        gowned female sits holding an infant.  Facing right, she looks down
                        at it as she rests her right arm 
                        across it.  To the right, facing them, stands a winged
                        female angel wearing a transparent gown who looks down at the infant and holds her hands out
                        toward it.  Each of her small wings is marked with a dot.  The
                        infant and seated mother(?) may be identified with the two speakers
                        of the poem; there, the infant names 
                        itself "Joy" (line 7).  A third stem of the plant, with no blossom
                        but with large leaves, grows across the bottom of the 
                        plate alongside the major stem; in the center-left margin yet
                        another stem sprouts from the main one.  Blue background washes suggest sky.</illusobjdesc>

                            bent, at her side; the 
                            right-most faces left and bends her arm up to hold the arm of the
                            middle figure.  At their feet and facing away from the viewer
                            kneels a fourth young female similarly dressed and coiffured.  She
                            looks toward the threesome rather than at the bard.  Her left arm is bent
                            upward, with her left hand raised and fingers spread apart.</illusobjdesc>

in contrapposto, watching his 
grazing flock of sheep.  He holds a crook in his left hand; his
shepherd's purse, or wallet, is visible 
near his right knee.  In the foreground, one of the sheep looks
forward and beside it another sheep lifts its head up, as if
looking back at the shepherd.  There is a ram just to the left of
the shepherd's lower right leg.  Up the right margin beside the
shepherd is a leafy tree, and a plant with lily-like
blossoms grows up beside its base.  The tree's
longest branch extends almost to the left margin.  There are more
trees and a hilltop in the background, where pink and yellow washes
suggest that the time is sunrise or sunset.  On the left a single
bird with broad wings and long tail feathers ascends.  Three smaller
birds soar to the right of the large bird.  At least one other bird, perhaps two, perches on the section of the branch below and to the right of the three flying birds.</illusobjdesc>

                                 <illusobjdesc>A young, curly-haired male shepherd in tights stands
                                     in contrapposto, watching his 
                                     grazing flock of sheep.  He holds a crook in his left hand; his
                                     shepherd's purse, or wallet, is visible 
                                     near his right knee.  In the foreground, one of the sheep looks
                                     forward and beside it another sheep lifts its head up, as if
                                     looking back at the shepherd.  There is a ram just to the left of
                                     the shepherd's lower right leg.  Up the right margin beside the
                                     shepherd is a leafy tree, and a plant with lily-like
                                     blossoms grows up beside its base.  The tree's
                                     longest branch extends almost to the left margin.  There are more
                                     trees and a hilltop in the background, where pink and yellow washes
                                     suggest that the time is sunrise or sunset.  On the left a single
                                     bird with broad wings and long tail feathers ascends.  Three smaller
                                     birds soar to the right of the large bird.  At least one other bird, perhaps two, perches on the section of the branch below and to the right of the three flying birds.</illusobjdesc>

a skirt or other drapery on her lap, sits facing a kneeling(?)
child who points upward with his left hand.  With her right hand
she reaches across her lap toward the boy.  Presumably they
correspond to the "mother" (lines 3, 7) and "Little Black Boy"
(title) of the text.  They are both dark of skin.  The
pair sits under the canopy of a leafy tree whose trunk grows up the
left margin behind the mother.  A vine twines upward around the tree trunk on the left in a counter-clockwise direction.  A second tree, with fewer leaves
and much smaller, grows up the right margin and arches over 
the sun.  A hilly plain stretches to the treeless horizon.  "The
rising sun" of the text (line 11) mounts above the horizon in a yellow and rosy sky.  Dark shadows extend below the figures and to the right along the ground and behind the female.</illusobjdesc>

					<illusobjdesc>The elements of the design combine and develop a selection of those on the previous Object. Christ, in conventional representation as a shepherd with beard, gown, and crook, sits facing left on a bank. Two nude boys—one blue-gray and one white in this copy—stand in front of him. One, probably the "little English boy" (line 7) whom the little black boy addresses in the final two stanzas of the poem, stands at Jesus's knee, holds his hands in a praying gesture, and looks up at Jesus, who looks down at him. The other boy, probably the little black boy from the previous Object though not as dark-skinned as he was there (presumably in conformation with the sense of "When I from black and he from white cloud free," line 8), stands behind the little English boy with his right hand out toward him to "stroke his silver hair" (line 12). All three are sheltered under a leafy, willow-like tree that forms a tight arch over their heads. A flock of sheep grazes to the left of the left-most boy. Wavy lines and blue-gray coloring suggest a river running at the foot of the plate. A vine rooted in the bank to the right of the tree grows up the right margin.</illusobjdesc>

                        are the most notable.  The left margin is dominated by a lattice of
                        branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  
                        Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin
                        carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very loopy tendrils
                        beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part
                        of the tree.  A figure playing a pipe stands next to the right
                        tree, lower left.  There is a second figure climbing in the
                        branches above, left of stanzas 7 and 8.  A third human form,
                        left of stanza 1, stands facing right with both arms raised. 
                        Blue, yellow, and pink washes around the designs suggest sky, perhaps at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

in the flame-like vegetation to the right of lines 6 and 7; a figure standing with arms raised and legs spread, perhaps dancing, in the vegetation to the right of line 11; a figure seated on one of the vines, with one leg bent and the other extended downward, at the right of line 16; and a figure walking right at the end of
lines 17-18.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Indeterminate vegetation of various sorts
interspersed with tiny human figures surrounds the text, especially
left, right, and top, and fills spaces between all the stanzas.  
The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves
that swirls in the spaces of the right margin (with a more
conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title,
and down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins
help separate the stanzas from one another.  The vine right of the
final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral. 
The vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top
of the plate above the title and fills the top right corner and the
space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of
letters in the title contribute to both forms of vegetation: the
initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the
text of the poem, occasional letters have modest decorative
extensions, and there are a few bits of stray decorative
vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A serpentine plant-like structure with
                        flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of
                        grassy ground that runs across the bottom of 
                        the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up
                        the left margin.  Between 
                        stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the
                        left margin and ends under the 
                        title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and
                        fourth stanzas and crosses into the 
                        right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward
                        flourish at top left.  The large plant 
                        is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted,
                        like the plant itself, at the bottom 
                        right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin right
                        of the standing figure and then, 
                        after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant,
                        which the vine continues to climb, finally terminating just left of
                        the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the
                        plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure. 
                        There are several human 
                        figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a nude female
                        with long hair walks right, trailing a flowing blue cloth; a second female, gowned and with long hair,
                        floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side,
                        facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned
                        figure stands, with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand
                        of a nude male figure to the left, who reclines 
                        with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically;
                        below and in front of this pair, a 
                        third figure, perhaps female and gowned, reclines, supported on her
                        left arm.  Blue background washes indicate sky, with suggestions of pink clouds at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        of "THURSDAY") and combinations of those with other long-leaved
                        plants (especially under the title).  Many of the
                        letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like
                        extensions.  After the area around the title, the 
                        most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between
                        stanzas, where rows of leaves and vines (most of them originating
                        in extensions of letters of the text in lines adjacent to the
                        spaces) alternate with an occasional bird (below "into the" in line
                        7) or human figure (beneath "innocent" in line 11).  Beneath the
                        final stanza is another particularly busy area of decoration,
                        dominated by vines and leaves but including a bird hovering on a
                        vine, wings outspread, facing the viewer.  Some of the decorations
                        are suggestive of birds (e.g., above "seated" in line 8 and above
                        "their" in line 11) or human figures (e.g., on the sprig of
                        vegetation beneath the "Y" of "HOLY") but are more likely to be

Dacre's dream of liberation for himself and his fellow sweeps by an
angel, who releases them from their "coffins of black" to 
run "naked" down a "green plain" and "wash in a river" (lines
14-18).  Against a leafy background of plants or perhaps trees are
twelve small figures.  At bottom right a gowned adult bends
forward, reaching toward a nude figure emerging from the earth or  
one of the coffins of the text.  Across the 
rest of the bottom of the plate are nude figures standing or
running with their arms raised in various positions.  Two pairs are
embracing. Behind the
gowned adult a tree grows up the right margin.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Several varieties of vegetation fill spaces around
                        the text and between stanzas.  The initial "A" in the title sprouts
                        a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like
                        extension dangles all the way down the left margin.  The vegetation
                        in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled 
                        grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or four clusters of flame-like
                        leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine
                        (after line 11) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14). 
                        In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 
                        and 5—is an odd tree(?) or perhaps a stump.  In front of the tree stands a figure,
                        robed, apparently wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the
                        "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in
                        human form.  He is one of four small human figures on the plate. 
                        The other three are in the area of the title: lying propped on an elbow on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps
                        reading or writing, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms
                        raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of
                        "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny
                        forms in the margins: there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5)
                        or beetle to the right of line 5 and perhaps another ant crawling beneath the "her"
                        in line 10, a worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower
                        right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 7, and beetles(?) (lines 20-21)
                        flying right of lines 6 and 19.  A bird, perhaps an eagle,
                        unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line
                        3.  Blue washes around the text indicate sky.</illusobjdesc>

                        boys(?) climbing, and another boy(?) sitting and reading.  In the
                        left margin is another elaborate vine with a large bird perched or flying
                        near its top, left of the first stanza.  A figure stands in these

                    <illusobjdesc>Eight figures gather around a table that sits on
                        grass against a wall of green vegetation.  Five figures sit behind
                        the table, away from the viewer; the female at far right extends
                        her arm to hold a drinking glass that rests on the table.  Near the
                        ends of the table on the front side, two other figures sit in
                        chairs that are turned sideways, facing one another.  Each figure
                        holds a glass on the table.  Between them an eighth figure, a male
                        in tights, stands facing away from the viewer.  In upraised hands
                        he holds a glass (right) and a plumed hat (left).  The faces of all
                        the figures on the far side of the table are visible. 
                        The three figures on the near side face away from the viewer toward
                        the rest of the company. The text mentions "green woods,"
                        "meadows," and a "table" in "the shade" (lines 3, 7, 11-12).  The 
                        suggestion of a shady refuge is reinforced by the slight shadows on the
                        ground, lower right, and up the right side of the illustration.</illusobjdesc>

                            vertically.  In his right hand is a wine glass or cup, in his left
                            a hat with a plume.  In the context of the poem his actions suggest
                            that he may be singing.</illusobjdesc>

faces right; a boy raises his arms 
higher, as does the long-haired girl to the right of him, whose

her hand, a boy runs left and reaches forward to hold the hand of
another running or striding boy, 
left leg extended behind him, who raises his free left hand as he
moves left and back, perhaps 
toward the opening between the pair furthest left.  All the girls
wear gowns; all the boys apparently wear

dense around the title, in the 
margins, and between the three stanzas.  The title area is full of
vegetative swirls, curls, and loops, 
much of it associated with the extravagant extensions of three
letters, the initial capitals "N" and 
"S" and the terminal "g."  There are also three prominent leafy
formations in this area: one at the top 
of the "S," another growing from the "N" of "Nurse's," and the
third in the top left corner.  Some 
of the loopy, vine-like decoration dangles in the left margin, and
a large leafy structure occupies
the space at the end of short line 5.  Below it is a leafy weeping
willow tree that leans right; its 
branches arch down into what may be water.  Between stanzas (after
lines 6, 10, and 14) and, in the right margin, at the ends of short
lines are other vine-like structures.  The initial letters of
stanzas 2, 3, and 4 have extensions that add to the decoration in
the left margin.  Several human figures populate 
the network of interlinear vegetation: two on the "N" of "Nurse's,"
climbing the left stroke and 
sitting on a leaf at the end of the curling right stroke; one
reaching downward through the following "u"; one leaning
against the "S" of "Song" with head propped on one hand, elbow on

three letters, the initial capitals "N" and "S" and the terminal
"g."  There are several long, slender leaves (the descender on the
"g," for instance), and there are three other prominent leafy
formations in this area: one at the top of the "S," another growing
from the "N" of "Nurse's," and the third in the top left corner. 
Some of the loopy, vine-like decoration dangles in the left margin,
and a large leafy structure occupies the space at the end of short
line 6.  Below it is a leafy weeping willow tree that leans right;
its branches arch down
into what may be water.  Between stanzas (after lines 6, 10, and 14)
and, in the right margin, at the ends of 
short lines are other vine-like structures.  The initial letters of
stanzas 2, 3, and 4 have extensions 
that add to the decoration in the left margin.</illusobjdesc>

                        large trees, a long-haired adult

                        grassy ground, toward the viewer.  The child raises his
                        right arm.  The adult has a lighted ring around his head that suggests a halo, from which beams of light extend.  The child appears to wear a hat, which also might suggest a halo.  The text describes the 
                        "little boy lost" who is "by the hand led" to safety by "God . . .

                        margin, bends under and 
                        around the left end of the title—whose lettering harmonizes with
                        the surrounding foliage—and 
                        curves back over it.  A second tree, much smaller, is also rooted
                        lower right; its branches cross behind the larger tree above the
                        angel opposite "nest" in line 19.  A second branch of the larger
                        tree continues up the right side of the plate to complete the
                        circle around the title.  Several leafy branches extend left into
                        the spaces left by short lines of the poem.  The tree is loosely
                        encircled by a leafy vine whose termination, perhaps a little
                        beyond the point where the tree bends left, is unclear.  Just left
                        of the trees, lower right, a lion lies in front of a hill or mound covered in grass.  There are winged angelic figures in the tree, one
                        standing with wings outspread at top right (faint in this copy), a second sitting with
                        wings folded on a branch beneath the first, and a third hovering
                        just above the lion's den.  Two birds perch on a branch right of
                        line 6.  In the left margin are other figures and objects (bottom
                        to top): one gowned, standing on the grassy ground and facing the
                        third stanza; just above that, a figure with one arm raised;

                        moon?); just above that another, smaller, with wings and arms
                        outspread.  All the figures may be the angels described in the text (Object 27, stanzas 2-3; Object 28, stanza 1). Above the top figure
                        on the left, left of line 6, is another sphere (the sun or moon?);
                        scattered across this same space in the left margin are several dots,
                        perhaps stars.  Blue background washes suggest sky.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A large tree, with a leafy vine lower left, grows up
                        the left margin, while its long, leafy branches extend above and
                        behind (as it were) the text well 
                        into the right margin.  On the ground, in front of a backdrop of
                        plants, five gowned female(?) figures stand in two groups.  To the
                        right, just under the branches, one female faces left and points or
                        gestures left with her upraised left arm as
                        she turns to look at her companion, who faces forward but looks
                        left toward her companion.  The heads of both figures are circled by white spheres, suggesting halos from which beams of radiance extend.  To the left, close to the tree trunk,
                        stand three other females, perhaps walking.  White areas around their heads suggest halos.  The left-most figure
                        has her arms crossed and looks right. 
                        The one in the middle, who seems to have long hair, looks forward and bends her right arm upward; she holds an indistinguishable object in her right hand.  The one to the right looks left and holds a harp or lyre by her side in her left hand. In the vine-encircled tree trunk in the left margin are two other gowned female(?) figures.  To the left of the third stanza on this plate, a gowned figure hovers beside the tree trunk.  To the left of the first stanza, a second figure may face left, though the position of the head is unclear in this copy.  The seven(?) figures collectively may be the angels mentioned in the text.</illusobjdesc>
