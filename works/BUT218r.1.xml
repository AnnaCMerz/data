This rejected design lends support to the supposition that Blake originally intended a different ending for his illuminated book than the one present in all extant copies.  The design, however, might illustrate the present ending of the poem when Thel flees the house of Clay (the grave) to return to "the vales of Har" (Erdman page 6).

                    <illusobjdesc>This pencil sketch is a preliminary for two plates in Blake's <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> of 1789.  The mock-up of the plate on the left includes the design used on Bentley plate 7, but in this sketch it appears as a headpiece above the roman numeral indicating the beginning of chapter III, which begins on Bentley plate 6 in the poem.  The mock-up on the right would thus presumably be for the next plate, Bentley plate 7.  The design, apparently showing Thel standing in front of the "house" of the "matron Clay" (Erdman page 6), was not used in <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>.  In the design at left, a vignette (or headpiece) of Thel, a seated gowned woman in a contracted position with legs drawn up and arms crossed over her knees, occupies the top register above horizontal lines, indicating the position of a text, in the lower half.  The larger figure below her is the "matron Clay"; the smaller figure to the left is the infant "Worm" (Erdman page 6).  The composition at right contains similar horizontal lines indicating text in the upper register while the vignette (or tailpiece) below depicts Thel with outstretched arms in front of the house of Clay as three figures fly or hover above.  These last figures may be Thel's "moans" which "flew o'er my [the Clay's] roof" (Erdman page 6).</illusobjdesc>

The figure at right is the "matron Clay" (<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>, Erdman page 6), a nude female figure who reclines on her side facing forward with head at left turned to look toward her companion at left.  The matron Clay is also referred to in the poem as the "Clod of Clay" (Erdman page 5).  She appears to have short hair.  Her left arm is extended and braced on the ground while her right is raised horizontally to reach or lean forward and touch the shoulder of the infant.  Her legs are extended with the left crossed over the right near the knee.</illusobjdesc>
