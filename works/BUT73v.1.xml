                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>A single male figure seen from behind stands in the center of this composition.  The figure is nude with prominent buttocks and has short curly hair.  His head is tilted up and both arms are raised horizontally, turning them so that both wrists face up and palms out.  His fingers, which are noticeably long, are spread with thumbs pointing up.  The expressiveness of this position may communicate the figure's ecstasy.  There are additional lines sketched in and near the palms of both hands, though the representational meaning of these is not clear.  They may be alternative positions for the fingers.  A small circular object, perhaps a ball(?), is visible above and right of his straightened right leg.  This circle may be a later addition not by Blake.  The figure raises his left leg, which is bent slightly backward at the knee, at 45 degrees.  He points his toes of his left foot to the left where they appear to touch or rest on tiptoe on a serpentine diagonal line that extends from the center of the lower edge of the design (below the figure's right foot) to the left side of the composition by the figure's left hand.  This line may indicate a geological form such as the outline of a rocky cliff.  A horizontal line bisects the right side of the scene and a semicircular shape, likely a rising or setting sun, is visible above this line.  The figure is likely the same character in a different position as the one sketched on the recto of this composition, a preliminary drawing for Blake's etching/engraving, "Albion rose."  The figure is not specifically identified as Albion until the inscription added to the plate c. 1820.</illusobjdesc>
