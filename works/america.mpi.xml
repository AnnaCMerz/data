<updatestmt>
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of sixteen impressions of plates for <hi rend="i">America a Prophecy</hi> not used in any copy of the poem, and a copperplate fragment.
<lb/>      
            <lb/> 
These loose impressions form a new category of graphic works, referred to in the index of copies as "MPI," an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions. As a group, MPIs reveal Blake's creative process as it unfolded through production, providing insights and new information about designs and texts. For example, Blake executed three plates that he rejected and did not use in any copy of <hi rend="i">America</hi>. They are designated Plates a, b, and c and are here displayed as Objects 6, 7, and 8. Plate a has the same text as Plate 5, with an added figure in flames holding a spear standing in the left margin. Plate b is a variant of Plate 6, with variants in design and text. Plate c is not a variant of any published plate and contains a unique text and designs. It may have been meant to be placed between Plates 10 and 11, or possibly after Plate b. Plate c includes complex pencil revisions by Blake. Plate d, another rejected plate, is already in the Archive under Separate Plates. It is known only because Blake used part of it to create “A Dream of Thiralatha,” which he included in the <hi rend="i">Large Book of Designs</hi>.    
    
    <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy U was printed in orange ink, given orange frame lines and page numbers, and finished in watercolors and pen and ink. It was produced in the same style on the same Ruse &amp; Turner paper as <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> Copy T, <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> Copy G, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> Copies O, N, and P, <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> Copies N and O, and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Copy D. This set of illuminated books&#8212;which, with the exception of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> Copy N, are in the Archive&#8212;was produced in 1818 and represents Blake’s return to illuminated printing. Except for a few copies of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> and <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> between 1802 and 1811, Blake had not printed an illuminated book&#8212;or a group of them together&#8212;since 1795. 
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
Object 17 shows a fragment of the copperplate of Plate a, which is the only surviving fragment of one of Blake’s copperplates etched in relief. The verso, Object 18, shows the head of a saint engraved by Thomas Butts, Jr., the son of Blake’s patron, who was studying engraving with Blake c. 1806-1808. 
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
Ten of the fourteen lifetime extant copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> were printed in 1793 on both sides of leaves in bluish and greenish black inks and left uncolored. Object 4, an impression of Plate 1 from the Rosenbach Museum, was printed with these copies, in bluish black ink, but it was finished in black and light sepia washes, the only impression among the <hi rend="i">America</hi> MPIs that was colored. Objects 9, 10, and 11, three impressions of Plate 4, were also printed among these first copies, when Blake masked the last five lines so that they would not print. Object 15 is an impression of Plate 15 that was presumably not used because it was too lightly printed in olive brown.
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
Object 16 is another impression of Plate 15, but in reddish brown ink, as are Objects 3 and 12, impressions of Plates 1 and 10. All three impressions in reddish brown are posthumous, printed by Frederick Tatham, who printed <hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy P, c. 1832, which is in the Archive, in this color. 
        <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
<hi rend="i">America</hi> Copy MPI can be accessed like plates in copies of <hi rend="i">America</hi> and compared with impressions from the same copperplate using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the second navigation bar below the image. The Archive will gradually publish groups of miscellaneous plates and impressions for each illuminated book (some groups consisting of over forty impressions), which will enable users to trace the evolution of Blake's printed designs.    
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 122 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images of Blake's works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes.     
    <lb/>      
            <lb/> 
    As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

                    <illusobjdesc>The design embodies the destructiveness of warfare. In the middle
                        distance is a stone wall with, on the right, the fragments of a top carved
                        with classical motifs. A great gap appears to the left, and in this gap sits
                        a giant winged figure. He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and
                        feet and both arms shackled and chained to the ground or to remnants of the
                        wall on which he squats or sits. His legs are drawn up in an extremely
                        contracted posture, with his knees to his shoulders. His head is lowered and
                        rests on his knees; his face is not pictured. His hair is long and curly.
                        The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. He may be Albion's
                        Angel, the representative of the establishment forces, or Orc, the
                        personification of revolution. To the right is a family group, all nude. A
                        woman, very probably a mother, sits on a fragment of the stone wall, legs
                        crossed. Her hair is long and her face expresses a brooding fear, despair,
                        or simply exhaustion. Her mouth is closed and the edges of her lips are turned
                        downwards. She holds in her lap a young child, probably male. He faces
                        forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman. His right knee is
                        prominent. Another child, of uncertain gender, leans against the woman's
                        left thigh and hip and hides his or her head below the woman's left arm.
                        This figure's legs are crossed at the ankles. We see this figure from
                        behind. On the ground below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and
                        further to the left is a dismounted cannon. The sky is dominated by dark
                        clouds, perhaps of smoke. </illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The design embodies the destructiveness of warfare. In the middle
                        distance is a stone wall with, on the right, the fragments of a top carved
                        with classical motifs. A great gap appears to the left, and in this gap sits
                        a giant winged figure. He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and
                        feet and both arms shackled and chained to the ground or to remnants of the
                        wall on which he squats or sits. His legs are drawn up in an extremely
                        contracted posture, with his knees to his shoulders. His head is lowered and
                        rests on his knees; his face is not pictured. His hair is long and curly.
                        The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. He may be Albion's
                        Angel, the representative of the establishment forces, or Orc, the
                        personification of revolution. To the right is a family group, all nude. A
                        woman, very probably a mother, sits on a fragment of the stone wall, legs
                        crossed. Her hair is long and her face expresses a brooding fear, despair,
                        or simply exhaustion. Her mouth is closed and the edges of her lips are turned
                        downwards. She holds in her lap a young child, probably male. He faces
                        forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman. His right knee is
                        prominent. Another child, of uncertain gender, leans against the woman's
                        left thigh and hip and hides his or her head below the woman's left arm.
                        This figure's legs are crossed at the ankles. We see this figure from
                        behind. On the ground below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and
                        further to the left is a dismounted cannon. The sky is dominated by dark
                        clouds, perhaps of smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The design embodies the destructiveness of warfare. In the middle
                        distance is a stone wall with, on the right, the fragments of a top carved
                        with classical motifs. A great gap appears to the left, and in this gap sits
                        a giant winged figure. He is nude and muscular, with prominent knees and
                        feet and both arms shackled and chained to the ground or to remnants of the
                        wall on which he squats or sits. His legs are drawn up in an extremely
                        contracted posture, with his knees to his shoulders. His head is lowered and
                        rests on his knees; his face is not pictured. His hair is long and curly.
                        The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair. He may be Albion's
                        Angel, the representative of the establishment forces, or Orc, the
                        personification of revolution. To the right is a family group, all nude. A
                        woman, very probably a mother, sits on a fragment of the stone wall, legs
                        crossed. Her hair is long and her face expresses a brooding fear, despair,
                        or simply exhaustion. Her mouth is closed and the edges of her lips are 
                        turned downwards. She holds in her lap a young child, probably male. He
                        faces forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman. His right knee is
                        prominent. Another child, of uncertain gender, leans against the woman's
                        left thigh and hip and hides his or her head below the woman's left arm.
                        This child's legs are crossed at the ankles. We see this child from
                        behind. On the ground below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and
                        further to the left is a dismounted cannon. The sky is dominated by dark
                        clouds, perhaps of smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                        turned downwards. She holds in her lap a young child, probably male. He
                        faces forward but perhaps looks up toward the woman. His right knee is
                        prominent. Another child, of uncertain gender, leans against the woman's
                        left thigh and hip and hides his or her head below the woman's left arm.
                        This child's legs are crossed at the ankles. We see this figure from
                        behind. On the ground below the woman is the haft of a broken sword, and
                        further to the left is a dismounted cannon. The sky is dominated by dark
                        clouds, perhaps of smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                            is lowered and rests on his knees; his face is not pictured. His hair is
                            long and curly. The contracted posture and lowered head suggest despair.
                            He may be Albion's Angel, the representative of the establishment

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, it appears as
                        though the plate is treated as a single design extending across the top one
                        third, down the left margin, and across the lower margin. A large tree,
                        perhaps an oak, with arching branches dominates the top left of the design.
                        The vegetation right and left of the large trunk may be separate bushes.
                        Below and to the right of its trunk is a large stone or an earthen bank
                        (possibly with a few tufts of grass) to which is shacked a nude, youthful
                        male by both hands and feet. His arms are spread out horizontally on the
                        rock, as if crucified; his legs are also spread apart. His torso and neck
                        are twisted, perhaps in pain; he faces up. His mouth is slightly open; he may be
                        speaking or crying in pain. His hair is curly; he is probably Orc, the
                        spirit of revolution here restrained. To the right are a nude male and
                        female, both standing. The female, with legs spread apart, grasps her head
                        with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. We do not see her face, but
                        her upper torso is twisted to the left—toward the shackled youth. She may be
                        Enitharmon, Orc's mother. Further to the right, the male stands with legs
                        spread apart. His body faces us, but he turns his head to the left and may
                        be looking at the shackled youth. His arms, with elbows bent, are raised
                        over his head, with his hands raised, palms out, and the fingers of both
                        hands spread apart. His hair is spiky or flame-like; his general expression
                        is one of horror or grief. His mouth may be slightly open; he may be
                        speaking or crying out in sorrow. This may be Los, Orc's father.
                        Alternatively, the couple has been identified as Adam and Eve, or as the
                        "Dark virgin" and Urthona (another name for Los) mentioned on this plate
                        (lines 12, 2). The roots of the tree descend through the left margin,
                        perhaps taking on anthropomorphic shapes. At the end of the roots, in the
                        far lower left corner of the plate, sits or squats a nude, youthful male in
                        a severely contracted posture. His legs are drawn up, with his head resting
                        on his knees. He faces forward, with a grim expression, and holds his
                        crossed hands over his ankles. His hair is curly or flame-like; his general
                        expression is one of horror or grief. This may be another representation of
                        Orc, as the personification of underground forces of revolution now enclosed
                        but with the potential to break out. A reticulated worm, with six loops,
                        fills the lower margin. The loops suggest (although they do not quite form)
                        a spiral.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The area above the text bearing the heading ("A / PROPHECY," lines
                        1-2) apparently represents the sky. Three birds fly on extended wings; one
                        of these seems to be soaring upwards. Upper left, a nude, muscular male also
                        seems to be ascending. He has apparently broken free of the chains that
                        still dangle from his wrists. His left arm is at his side; his right arm is
                        bent back over his right shoulder. His right leg is bent behind him out of
                        view. His hair may be curly. He faces forward, with head tilted up. This may
                        be another representation of Orc or, more generally, humanity freed from its
                        chains by revolution. The words of the heading are integrated into
                        vegetative design motifs, including several vines with leaves, spiraling
                        vines growing from the first and last letters of "PROPHECY" (line 2), and
                        grain stems and tassels growing from the first word of the heading ("A,"

                        that the pictorial image is treated as a full-plate design. Centered
                        just below line 2 is a winged dragon of a type traditionally called a
                        wyvern. The creature is apparently flying through the air. It faces to the
                        left, with a coiled or spiral tail with two loops on the right. Its skin
                        looks scaly and its face is somewhat dog-like, with a partly opened mouth
                        and large teeth. The top of its head bears a crest. Its front paws look
                        almost like human hands. Below and to the left of its left paw is a jagged
                        line, perhaps representing a bolt of lightning. Further to the left, and
                        descending into the left margin, is an old man. His gown forms a long,
                        snake-like tail behind him, rather like the wyvern's tail. He has a long
                        beard and long hair. His right arm is at his side, but we can see that, with
                        his right hand, he grasps a large book or tablet. His left arm reaches
                        downward and he holds in his left hand a scepter or spear with a point. This
                        figure may be Albion's Angel or Urizen (twice referred to in the text) with
                        his book of laws. Below this descending figure is another jagged line,
                        perhaps representing lightning, and several cloud outlines extending to the
                        right margin above and below the last eight lines of text. Below these
                        billowing clouds, in the plate's lower margin, is a landscape that includes
                        a male figure. He is nude and squats or kneels on the ground, with his upper
                        body bent forward. Both arms are raised and bent at the elbows; he grasps
                        his head with both hands. This gesture expresses despair or terror. To the
                        right of the figure is a fallen tree with a limb extending into the right
                        margin. </illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The plate is primarily text, but is decorated with clouds and four figures.  The uppermost figure, probably male, lies on a cloud with 
                    his torso turned to the left, and his head buried in his arms. The second 
                    figure -- another nude man -- flies head-first towards the ground. He blows
                    into a large trumpet pointed at a nude man and a nude woman below. In the
                    plate's lower left corner, the two figures appear to be engaged in a sexual 
                    act. The woman faces forward, with her arms lifted and her fingers spread 
                    wide. Her posture suggests surrender or ecstasy. She appears to be standing 
                    in front of a stony surface, perhaps the "mountains &amp; cliffs of snow" 
                    mentioned in the text. The man, seen from behind, stands in front of her. 
                    His physique is muscular and his legs are positioned powerfully and 
                    comfortably apart; he may either be embracing or restraining the woman. 
                    At their feet appears to be the rocky surface of the ground. The positioning 
                    of the text and the interlinear illustrations suggests clouds.</illusobjdesc>

                        an ambiguous figure, possibly a woman wearing a dress, who faces left. A
                        small nude figure hovers to the left of the text. With legs and arms
                        extended, the figure flies downward and to the right toward the letter “H”
                        in "He" in line 3 of the printed text. Two birds fly above “Albions Angel rose” and another two
                        birds fly to the left of “His” in line 4 of the printed text. Small birds fly to the left of
                        line 4, above line 15, and to the right of lines 21-24 of the printed text.The upper torso of a figure, who appears to be an old, bearded man, is shown with arms extended to the right of line 6 of the printed text. He
                        resembles the figure on Plate 12 in this copy. A small figure with legs
                        outspread grasps a vine to the right of "pillar" in line 14 of the printed text. To the right of
                        line 26 of the printed text, a female, possibly gowned, figure flies to the left. Two additional figures may sit on a vine to the right.

                        the ground. The figure's right knee and foot are prominent; his hands are

                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains a good deal of text, Blake treated the
                        pictorial image as a full-plate design. Above, an old, bearded, and gowned
                        man sits among clouds. His long hair cascades over his left shoulder. He
                        faces forward, but looks slightly to the left. His arms are raised
                        horizontally; his hands seem to be holding the clouds on which they rest,
                        palms down. His right leg is drawn up toward his chest in a contracted
                        posture; the right knee and foot are prominent. His left leg is not
                        pictured. The lines below his right foot may be a fold of his garment, but
                        possibly a sandal. This figure is very probably Urizen. At the bottom of the
                        plate is a dark and stormy sea with waves. The text panel is shaped in such
                        a way as to suggest a cloud between the upper and lower parts of the design,
                        or possibly a break between clouds. The design, particularly the figure,
                        offers a contrasting parallel to the design on Plate 14 in this
                        copy.</illusobjdesc>

                        is treated as a full-plate design. Below the text, a nude, muscular,
                        youthful male rises among flames. His hair is curly and snake-like; his
                        mouth is open. He faces forward, but looks slightly to the left. His left
                        leg is bent at the knee, as though he were stepping up and rising; his right
                        leg is covered by flames. The figure is very probably Orc, the spirit of
                        revolution. His arms are raised horizontally, with his hands resting on the
                        flames. The visible fingers of both hands are spread apart; both hands are
                        poised as though the man was calling forth the flames that surround him. The
                        flames (of hell?) and accompanying smoke extend up both margins to the top
                        of the plate and appear in the spaces between the text, particularly between
                        lines 4 and 5. The design offers a contrasting parallel to the design on

                        bent back and her long hair descends below, as does her dangling right arm.
                        She is probably dead, perhaps from drowning. Some spiky vegetation grows to
                        the left of her head. A large bird, very probably an eagle, is perched on
                        her right upper leg. The eagle's wings are extended and his curved beak
                        hovers above the woman's abdomen. The bird may be eating (or about to eat)
                        the corpse. The sky behind the bird is filled with clouds; both the sky and
                        the sea on the right (perhaps the Atlantic, named several times in the text)
                        are stormy. Below the text we see the dark waters of the deep and the bottom
                        of the sea. Upon it lies supine a nude male, with his knees bent slightly
                        and his left arm at his side. His body is emaciated and rigid; he is no
                        doubt dead, probably from drowning. We can see his ribs; perhaps the sea
                        creatures around him have been eating his flesh. These include one large
                        fish and two small ones, all with their mouths open. A sea snake coils
                        itself around the man's legs; another snake hovers above his chest. Five
                        much smaller fish appear immediately below the text and in the right margin
                        following the final two lines of text. Below the man, on the floor of the
                        sea, are two further sea snakes or worms. Near the lower right corner is a
                        large, spiral shell, probably a whelk (common to the Atlantic). There are two other, much smaller shells, one below the man's neck and one in the far lower right corner of the plate. Vegetation rises
                        in the left margin of the text almost touching the female figure on the rocky 
                        shore. This vegetation may be seaweed. The twisted, loopy lines include, left
                        of lines 5-8 of the text, a snake with an open mouth.</illusobjdesc>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Although the plate contains considerable text, the pictorial image
                        is treated as a full-page design showing the surface and bottom of the sea.
                        Above the text, the limp body of a nude female lies supine on a stony shore,
                        with her legs on the right extending into the waves of the sea. Her head is
                        bent back and her long hair descends below, as does her dangling right arm.
                        She is probably dead, perhaps from drowning. Some spiky vegetation grows to
                        the left of her head. A large bird, very probably an eagle, is perched on
                        her right upper leg. The eagle's wings are extended and his curved beak
                        hovers above the woman's abdomen. The bird may be eating (or about to eat)
                        the corpse. The sky behind the bird is filled with clouds; both the sky and
                        the sea on the right (perhaps the Atlantic, named several times in the text)
                        are stormy. Below the text we see the dark waters of the deep and the bottom
                        of the sea. Upon it lies supine a nude male, with his knees bent slightly
                        and his left arm at his side. His body is emaciated and rigid; he is no
                        doubt dead, probably from drowning. We can see his ribs; perhaps the sea
                        creatures around him have been eating his flesh. These include one large
                        fish and two small ones, all with their mouths open. A sea snake coils
                        itself around the man's legs; another snake hovers above his chest. Five
                        much smaller fish appear immediately below the text and in the right margin
                        following the final two lines of text. Below the man, on the floor of the
                        sea, are two further sea snakes or worms. Near the lower right corner is a
                        large, spiral shell, probably a whelk (common to the Atlantic). There is one 
                        much smaller shell below the man's neck. In the far lower right corner is a 
                        minimally representational form that may be another shell. Vegetation rises in
                        the left margin of the text almost touching thefemale figure on the rocky shore. 
                        This vegetation may be seaweed. The twisted, loopy lines include, left of 
                        lines 6-9 of the text, a snake with an open mouth.</illusobjdesc>

                        vines. The first letter of the first word in line 3 sprouts into two vines,
                        one with a flower or leaf at its termination (on the left) and one with two
                        loops (on the right). The final letter of "England" in line 3 grows into a
                        vine with one loop. On line 5 is a row of vines, some with leaves. Sitting
                        on one such vine, just right of the word "cry" (line 5), is a small figure

                    This copperplate fragment includes portions of the title, main text, and illustrations to America, Bentley 5 (Erdman 3, Keynes 3). The bottom-most curves of the "ECY" in  "PROPHECY" appear along the top edge of the plate. The descender of "Y" extends to the top left edge of the plate; one loop in the descender may be cut off. A bird with extended wings and a forked tale rises to the right of the descender. A portion of the horizontal body of a hovering figure appears in the bottom left of the plate. The figure's legs extend horizontally behind it; the left leg bends at the knee. It appears to be nude and seen from behind with its muscular calves, thighs, buttocks, and back bared. A serpentine line below the figure extends from its waist and ends to the right of its feet. Short, vertical lines above the figure's back form an indeterminate shape that resembles grass or grain tassels, and obscures portions of three lines of text.

            <objnote><p>This copperplate is the back of a fragment cut from the left side of the copperplate of *America* Plate a (see Object 17 for the recto of this copperplate and Object 6 for an impression of Plate a).  This verso of the copperplate was used by Thomas Butts, Jr., to etch and engrave his own work.  Butts was a student of Blake's in the graphic arts beginning no later than 1806 and continuing until at least 1808.  Butts may have copied the image from the work of another artist.  Blake probably assisted Butts in the execution of this etching and engraving.</p></objnote>
