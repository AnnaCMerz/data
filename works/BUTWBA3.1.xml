                    <p>These sketches, not discovered until 1993 and thus not in Butlin, are
                        alternative designs for Blake's engraving in Thomas Commins, *An Elegy Set
                        to Music*, dated 1786 in the imprint on Blake's engraving. These sketches
                        are on the verso of a monochrome wash drawing also for the Commins
                        engraving. Another pair of recto/verso drawings, both in monochrome wash,
                        for this engraving is in the Essick collection; these drawings are also
                        titled *Alternative Designs for Commins's Elegy* (not in Butlin because not
                        discovered until 1992).</p>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Several separate scenes are visible in this drawing. Lower left, a
                        short-haired figure seated in a boat bends both arms to hold oars. He(?)
                        faces left but turns his head to look right, perhaps toward the figures
                        standing on the land at right. The frontmost of these two standing figures
                        appears to face away from the viewer. He(?) wears a gown and possibly a
                        hood. The figure in back may face left; one arm, extended downward, and hand
                        are visible. An unidentifiable motif of some sort is sketched below these
                        figures. Against the right edge of the drawing, a third figure, who may be
                        bearded, appears to lean forward and to the left (perhaps over some sort of
                        horizontal barrier?) with both arms extended downward. A smaller version of
                        a similar figure appears below. An oval form in the upper left corner
                        contains a separate scene drawn upside down that depicts three figures. When
                        viewing the scene right side up, a single figure at left stands facing right
                        with both arms raised horizontally beside what appears to be a boat. There
                        may be a tree with leafy foliage behind this figure at left. He(?) may reach
                        and stride toward the pair of figures standing or walking across from him at
                        right facing left. The shorter figure, who may be a child, raises its right
                        arm at 135 degrees; the taller figure wears a gown and may be female. These
                        two figures appear to stand on an area of ground of a shore, but it is
                        unclear whether the single figure also stands on the ground or partially in
                        the water depicted in the foreground. This scene is likely related to
                        Blake's 1786 engraving for Commins's *An Elegy Set to Music* which has a
                        similar oval composition and figural arrangement. The other vignettes in the
                        drawing probably also relate to this project.</illusobjdesc>

                            Both legs are bent at the knees. He faces left but turns his head to
                            look right, perhaps toward the figure standing on the land at
                            right.</illusobjdesc>

                            size, suggest it is a rowboat. There may be additional objects inside
                            the boat behind the figure, but the significance of these is
                            indeterminate.</illusobjdesc>

                            perhaps in a gesture toward the figure seated in the boat at

                            the pair of figures across from him at right. The figure appears to wear
                            a garment, perhaps a shirt or gown, that extends outward from his body
                            at right, as if lifted by the wind. He may be striding rapidly to the
                            right or leaping over the water.</illusobjdesc>
