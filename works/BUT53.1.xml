                <objnote><p>This work is probably part of Blake's series of water colors illustrating English history rather than an illustration of Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi>.  Indeed, the scene does not appear in the play, although Blake may be picturing what Lear imagines will happen in his great speech in Act V scene 3 beginning "No, no, no, no!  Come, let's away to prison."  There Lear and Cordelia will "wear out" their days "in a walled prison."  Even if the design is not based directly on Shakespeare's play, his treatment of Lear and his daughters is so culturally powerful that an association of this subject with his play is difficult to avoid.  The placement of Lear and Cordelia in prison may have been influenced by Nahum Tate’s adaptation of <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi> of 1681.  The stage direction to the third scene of Act V places them in "A Prison. Lear asleep, with his head on Cordelia’s lap."  An inscription below the drawing on the mat (not shown) reads "Lear and Cordelia (early manner)."  An inscription on the back of the mat reads "Bought of Mrs. Blake the first or second year after her husband's death. Price of this and 'the Grave' [Butlin 134] was about &#163;8.8."  The longer inscription was probably written by Mrs. Samuel Smith or Julia Smith; another inscription on the back of the mat reads in part "Exhibited at Burlington Fine Arts Club 1876 No. 223 lent by Miss Julia Smith."  The catalogue for this exhibition states that the lender was "Miss Julia Smith."</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In a room with stone walls that suggests a prison cell, a gowned female figure with long curly hair sits facing right with her head turned down to look toward an older male figure who lies on the ground with his head in her lap. The female figure wraps her bent right arm across her chest and bends her left arm upward near her face. Her legs are bent with both bare feet visible at left. She wears a swath of drapery around her lower body; additional drapery, which she may hold in her right hand, extends out from her torso at right in a serpentine flourish. The male figure, whose eyes appear to be closed, has white hair and a beard.  He may be sleeping. He wears a gown or tunic, and blue drapery covers his torso and the floor below him. He raises both bent arms above his head to rest on the female figure’s lap with his left hand touching his right wrist. Both of his legs are bent but extended to the right. The water color probably represents the characters Lear, the King of Britain, and Cordelia, his youngest daughter. This specific scene does not appear in Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi>, although Blake may be picturing what Lear imagines will happen in his great speech in Act V scene 3 beginning "No, no, no, no!  Come, let's away to prison."  There Lear and Cordelia will "wear out" their days "in a walled prison."  The scene does occur in Nahum Tate’s adaptation of <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi> of 1681 in the stage direction to the third scene of Act V: "Scene, A Prison. Lear asleep, with his head on Cordelia’s lap." This water color is probably one of Blake's illustrations to English history rather than directly related to Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">King Lear</hi>.</illusobjdesc>

Bending forward slightly, she wraps her bent left arm across her chest and bends her left arm upward near her face, perhaps touching it. She may hold drapery in her left hand.

                        <illusobjdesc>A male figure lies on the ground facing forward with his head resting on the lap of the female figure at left. He has short white hair and a beard; his eyes appear to be closed, suggesting he is sleeping. He wears a gown or tunic with long sleeves, and blue drapery covers his torso and the floor below him. Both arms are bent and raised above his head to rest on the female figure’s lap with his left hand touching his right wrist. Both of his legs are bent but extended to the right.  This figure is probably Lear, the King of Britain, as a prisoner.</illusobjdesc>
