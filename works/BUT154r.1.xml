                <note>Probably inherited by Blake's wife Catherine at his death in 1827; acquired by

                    dealer Joseph Hogarth, sold from his stock, Southgate and Barrett auction,
                    London, 7-30 June 1854, lot 5082, with 21 other works by Blake, on the twelfth
                    evening (16s. to "Edsall," probably a dealer); Richard Johnson; sold from
                    Johnson's collection, Platt's auction, London, 25 April 1912, lot 702 with 16
                    other works (&#163;11.11s. to Archibald G. B. Russell); sold Sotheby's, 28 May
                    1934, lot 171 with another pencil drawing (wrongly?) attributed to Blake
                    (&#163;5.10s. to Geoffrey Keynes); bequeathed by Keynes in 1982 to the
                    Fitzwilliam Museum and accessioned by the Fitzwilliam in 1985.</note>

                    <illusobjdesc>In this drawing, six figures sit in chairs around a table and one
                        figure stands in the foreground. Facing forward yet looking right, the
                        standing figure has curly hair and perhaps a beard. He bends both arms
                        upward with palms facing forward and fingers spread widely. His stance is
                        wide, and he appears to look directly toward the seated figure at far right,
                        who returns his gaze facing left. This figure, also male, has short curly
                        hair and extends both arms so his hands rest on his bent knees. Detailing
                        near the figure's chest may indicate some decoration on his clothing, though
                        this is unclear. To the left of this figure, the second figure from the
                        right sits behind a table facing forward and looking down. He has short
                        curly hair and perhaps a beard. To the left of this figure, a fourth figure
                        is seen from behind facing away from the viewer and seated on some kind of
                        backless chair or bench. This figure appears to have long hair. His arms
                        appear bent at the elbows and he may cross his right leg behind his extended
                        left. Across the table, a fifth head (with indistinguishable facial
                        features) and torso is visible and may face forward. At far left, the sixth
                        figure is a gowned female who sits facing right. She appears to wear her
                        long hair in a coiffure and rest at least her bent right arm on the table.
                        At least four vertical forms are visible behind the figures and may suggest
                        columns or pilasters or perhaps wall paneling. This drawing may illustrate a
                        scene from Macbeth in which Macbeth (standing) encounters in horror the
                        Ghost of Banquo (seated far right) while at dinner with Lady Macbeth (seated
                        far left) and others.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>In this drawing, six figures sit in chairs around a table and
                            one figure stands in the foreground. The figure at far right, who is
                            male, has short curly hair and sits in a reclining posture. He extends
                            both arms so his hands rest on his bent knees. Detailing near the
                            figure's chest may indicate some decoration on his clothing, though this
                            is unclear. He may be the Ghost of Banquo, recognized by Macbeth in
                            horror. There may be some resemblance between the profile of this figure
                            and Blake's own.</illusobjdesc>
