<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a
                digital edition of forty-three pencil drawings produced by Blake during his first
                decade as an independent artist, 1779-1790. Drawing lies at the core of Blake's life
                as an artist. Pencil was his preferred medium for sketching—more flexible, less
                expensive, and more easily corrected than pen and ink or chalk. Preliminary work
                with the pencil preceded more finished work, either as separate sketches for prints
                and paintings or as drawings underlying water colors. Blake's nineteenth-century
                writings on the arts testify to his conviction that drawing was fundamental to all
                pictorial expression: "The distinction that is made in modern times between a
                Painting and a Drawing proceeds from ignorance of art. The merit of a Picture is the
                same as the merit of a Drawing" (*A Descriptive Catalogue*, Erdman
                page 549); "Let a Man who has made a Drawing go on &amp; on &amp; he will produce a Picture
                or Painting but if he chooses to leave off before he has spoild it he will Do a
                Better Thing[.]" (*Public Address*, Erdman page 576); "Painting is
                Drawing on Canvas &amp; Engraving is Drawing on Copper &amp; Nothing Else…&amp; he who Draws
                best must be the best Artist…." (*Public Address*, Erdman page 582);
                "Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness, for I am really drunk with
                intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or graver into my hand…." (letter to
                William Hayley, 1804, Erdman page 757). <lb/>
                <lb/> Blake no doubt executed a great many more pencil drawings than those extant
                today. Sketches were not intended for exhibition or sale; most were probably
                discarded, while others may have been retained only because of more developed
                compositions on the other side of the leaves. Even the slightest and least
                aesthetically ambitious drawings offer insights into the origins and earliest
                realizations of Blake’s designs. These first thoughts on paper often tell us more
                about Blake’s habits of mind, when joined by eye and hand, than more finished works.
                Sketches are “the first fruits of [Blake’s] imagination,” as Geoffrey Keynes states
                in the introduction to his *Pencil Drawings of William Blake*
                (1927). <lb/>
                <lb/> The forty-three pencil drawings presented here, produced in Blake’s first
                decade as an independent artist, show his early debt to academic standards of
                precise copying and to the neoclassical emphasis on outline. The first four works
                may have been drawn while Blake was a student in the Royal Academy schools. Other
                sketches are preliminaries for some of Blake’s most important designs. Among these
                are the *Study for “Glad Day”, or “Albion Rose”* (Object 6),
                Blake’s iconic vision of the human form divine in energetic pose, and three sketches
                (Objects 34-36) for illustrations to *Tiriel*, the only group of
                finished drawings Blake composed for one of his own poems. Several sketches are
                early efforts at picturing events in the Bible, Blake’s main inspiration for designs
                throughout his life. This biblical cluster includes *The Resurrection of
                    the Dead* (Object 10), *Samuel Presenting Saul to the
                    People* (Object 15), and *Job’s Wife and Other Sketches*
                (Object 31). Other studies, such as *Ugolino in Prison* and its
                verso (Objects 21-22), reveal the beginnings of subjects also of lifelong interest
                for Blake. Only a few drawings for Blake’s illuminated books have survived, but
                studies such as *Sketches for “The Book of Thel”* and *A
                    Standing and a Recumbent Figure* (Objects 37-39) offer fascinating glimpses
                into Blake’s methods of graphic production and revision. <lb/>

                    <illusobjdesc>In this drawing, six figures sit in chairs around a table and one
                        figure stands in the foreground. Facing forward yet looking right, the
                        standing figure has curly hair and perhaps a beard. He bends both arms
                        upward with palms facing forward and fingers spread widely. His stance is
                        wide, and he appears to look directly toward the seated figure at far right,
                        who returns his gaze facing left. This figure, also male, has short curly
                        hair and extends both arms so his hands rest on his bent knees. Detailing
                        near the figure's chest may indicate some decoration on his clothing, though
                        this is unclear. To the left of this figure, the second figure from the
                        right sits behind a table facing forward and looking down. He has short
                        curly hair and perhaps a beard. To the left of this figure, a fourth figure
                        is seen from behind facing away from the viewer and seated on some kind of
                        backless chair or bench. This figure appears to have long hair. His arms
                        appear bent at the elbows and he may cross his right leg behind his extended
                        left. Across the table, a fifth head (with indistinguishable facial
                        features) and torso is visible and may face forward. At far left, the sixth
                        figure is a gowned female who sits facing right. She appears to wear her
                        long hair in a coiffure and rest at least her bent right arm on the table.
                        At least four vertical forms are visible behind the figures and may suggest
                        columns or pilasters or perhaps wall paneling. This drawing may illustrate a
                        scene from Macbeth in which Macbeth (standing) encounters in horror the
                        Ghost of Banquo (seated far right) while at dinner with Lady Macbeth (seated
                        far left) and others.</illusobjdesc>

                            arms upward with palms facing forward and fingers spread widely. His
                            stance is wide, and he appears to look directly toward the seated figure
                            at far right. This figure may be Macbeth who is seeing the Ghost of

                            male, has short curly hair and sits in a reclining posture. He extends
                            both arms so his hands rest on his bent knees. Detailing near the

                            is unclear. He may be the Ghost of Banquo, recognized by Macbeth in
                            horror. There may be some resemblance between the profile of this figure
                            and Blake's own.</illusobjdesc>
