                <objnote><p>The underlying etched and engraved image is in the first state of two.  The thinness of the color printing indicates that this is the second impression (or "pull"); the first color printed impression is in *A Large Book of Designs* copy A in the British Museum.  The figure is identified as Albion in the inscription below the design added to the second state of the print, c. 1820-25, but it is not certain that the figure represents Albion in this first state.  Blake's inscribed initials and date within the design were probably also added c. 1820-25.  If however present in the first state, the inscription within the design is completely masked by color printing in both known impressions of the first state.  This impression of the first state is inscribed "9" in pencil below the bottom left corner of the design and, in pencil partly erased, "an additional plate," bottom right.  These inscriptions are not by Blake and pertain to the placement of the plate when bound with *The Song of Los* copy E (see the Provenance).  There are two additional pencil inscriptions on the verso, also not by Blake: "end" and "14," both lower right.</p></objnote>

                        A nude male figure stands in the center of the design with his arms raised horizontally and palms facing out. He is identified as Albion in the inscription below the design added to the second state of the print, c. 1820-25, but it is not certain that the figure represents Albion in this first state. He has short hair and faces forward. His legs are spread and his genitals are clearly visible. The ground (apparently a hill, mound, or stone rising from right to left) below is mottled, suggesting moss or lichens. Coloring around the figure indicates a sunrise, sunset, or a burst of radiance with beams of light emanating from the figure. A cloud or clouds may appear right and left of Albion's left leg. Darkness appears in the lower right corner of the design and extends horizontally to the left border between the ground and the radiance. Faint vertical lines lower right may suggest rain.
