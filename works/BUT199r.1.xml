                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>Near the center of the composition, Tiriel, an old man with a long
                        beard, stands in profile facing right with both arms extended horizontally.
                        He wears a gown. A straight-backed chair (perhaps a throne?) is visible
                        behind him at left and some sort of drapery above. Two female figures,
                        Tiriel's daughters, kneel in front of him with arms wrapped around his legs.
                        These figures are also gowned and each extends one leg backward. A third
                        gowned female, presumably another daughter, crouches in the lower left
                        corner facing right and wraps her arms around her knees. To the right of a
                        pillar or part of a wall, three male figures, Tiriel's sons, stand facing
                        forward against the right margin of the composition. The rightmost figure
                        has short curly hair and turns his head left, likely to look at the central
                        old man. His mouth is open and both arms are crossed in front of his chest.
                        With his right hand, he holds a sword aloft. The middle figure has short
                        curly hair and a beard and wears a spiky crown. His mouth is open. With both
                        arms bent upward, he clutches his face (or perhaps covers his ears?). The
                        leftmost male has short hair that appears to stand on end and a beard. With
                        an open mouth, he turns left, likely to look at Tiriel. The expressions of
                        all three figures suggest terror or despair.</illusobjdesc>
