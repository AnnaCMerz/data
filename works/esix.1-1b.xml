                <note>Possibly one of the works acquired from Blake in Aug. 1797 by James Curry or at an unknown time by George Romney; possibly acquired by Isaac D'Israeli, who died in 1848; his son, Benjamin D'Israeli, later Earl of Beaconsfield; sold Hodgson auction, London, 14 Jan. 1904, lot 223 (&#163;42 to the dealer Bernard Quaritch acting for F. P. Osmaston); Mrs. L. M. Osmaston, probably by inheritance; sold from her collection, Sotheby's, 14 Nov. 1928, lot 692 (&#163;170 to the dealer Gabriel Wells, probably acting for Mr. and Mrs. Anton G. Hardy); sold from the Hardy collection, Parke-Bernet, 14 Jan. 1942, lot 20 ($575 to the dealer A. S. W. Rosenbach acting for Lessing J. Rosenwald); given by Rosenwald to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., in 1943.</note>

                <objnote><p>This is the second pull from the plate; the first pull is in the British Museum as part of *A Large Book of Designs* Copy A. The design was very probably etched on a larger copperplate, including text above, originally produced for Blake's illuminated book, *America a Prophecy* (1793), cancelled Plate d, but not printed in the book. The copperplate was either cut down to this design or the upper portion of the plate was masked during printing. The remaining text can be read as a blind embossment on the verso of this impression&#8212;see the Supplemental Views.

                        Just right of the center of the composition, a female figure who appears to be sleeping sits in a contracted postion facing left.  She is probably the dreaming Thiralatha. She has long hair and may be nude above the waist where she wears a gown, skirt, or drapery. With her face turned down, the figure bends forward to rest her head and left arm on her bent left knee. There may be a band (perhaps jewelry or a shackle?) visible around her left upper arm. Her right leg rests on the ground and is bent beneath her left leg with the sole of her right foot facing forward. The trunk of a bare, three-branched tree rooted at right arches to the left over the female figure, echoing her contracted position. A pair of figures is visible to the left of the seated female figure and tree near the left edge of the composition. A nude female figure with long hair stands or walks facing left and raises both arms to hold a nearly upside-down nude child, whose face she kisses with her head upturned. The female figure bends her right leg, which is extended slightly behind her; one of the tree's thin branches extends behind her legs at the knee. The gender of the child she holds is not clear, though he(?) has short hair. The child, who may fly or hover, faces down and to the right though his head is bent back to kiss the face of the female figure. His right arm is raised and extended to touch the neck of the female figure. Both legs are extended up, with the right leg bent back at a right angle. The female figure and child at left may be representations of Thiralatha's dream. A dark sky that may contain clouds is visible in the background of the composition.

                        <illusobjdesc>A pair of figures is visible to the left of the seated female figure and tree near the left edge of the composition. A nude female figure with long hair stands or walks facing left and raises both arms to hold a nearly upside-down nude child, whose face she kisses with her head upturned. The female figure bends her right leg, which is extended slightly behind her; one of the tree's thin branches extends behind her legs at the knee. The female figure may be a representation of Thiralatha herself in her dream.</illusobjdesc>

A nude female figure raises both arms to hold a nearly upside-down nude child, whose face she kisses with her head upturned. The gender of the child is not clear, though he(?) has short hair. The child, who may fly or hover, faces down and to the right though his head is bent back to kiss the face of the female figure. His right arm is raised and extended to touch the neck of the female figure. Both legs are extended up, with the right leg bent back at a right angle. The female figure and child may be representations of Thiralatha's dream.</illusobjdesc>
