                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, a nude male figure with long hair sits facing forward.  His left arm, which is bent upward, rests on his bent left knee; in his left hand, the figure holds a faintly drawn staff or shepherd's crook, which appears to rest against his head.  A diagonal strap is visible across his chest and appears to hold a cloak that dangles behind his right arm.  His bent right arm rests in his lap on his bent right leg.  With his right hand, he holds or supports a lyre that leans against his right leg.  This figure may lean against the trunk of a tree visible upper left.  There may be a mountain or hill visible upper right.  In the lower right corner of the composition, a nude seated figure seen upside down facing left holds a harp.  To the left of this figure's left foot is a standing(?) figure drawn sideways with arms at its side.  There are also three drawings of a nude man reclining on his side, two on the right, drawn with the paper held horizontally, and one of the left, similarly drawn but with the paper held the other way up.  There are additional indeterminate lines and forms throughout the composition.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>There are three drawings of a nude man with short hair reclining on his side, two on the right, drawn with the paper held horizontally, and one of the left, similarly drawn but with the paper held the other way up.  Each of these figures reclines on his right side with both arms at his side and left leg bent backward and perhaps crossed near the ankles.  The bodies face forward but their heads are shown in profile facing the same direction as their extended legs.  The figures on the right may wear hats.</illusobjdesc>
