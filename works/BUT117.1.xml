                    <illusobjdesc>Two male figures stand facing forward in this drawing.  The figure at right appears to have short curly hair, thick brows, and a beard.  His mouth is open.  With right arm bent at 90 degrees and held in front of his chest and left arm extended by his side, palm facing forward with fingers spread, he stands with legs spread in a slightly contrapposto position, right foot turned to point left.  He may wear some kind of cape or robe, visible behind his legs.  The facial details of the figure at left are unarticulated, but he wears a tall conical hat and a long cape or robe similar to his companion's.  Facing forward but turned slightly right, he raises his bent left arm above the head of the other figure (perhaps touching his head?) and extends his right arm, raised at 45 degrees, diagonally across his body.  This drawing may be an illustration of the biblical narrative in I Samuel 12:13 in which Samuel, the figure at left, presents Saul, the figure at right, as king.</illusobjdesc>

The facial details of the figure at left are unarticulated, but he wears a tall conical hat and a gown along with a long cape or robe similar to his companion.  Facing forward but turned slightly right, he raises his bent left arm above the head of the other figure (perhaps touching his head?) and extends his right arm, raised at 45 degrees, diagonally across his body.  This drawing may be an illustration of the biblical narrative in I Samuel 12:13 in which Samuel, the figure at left, presents Saul, the figure at right, as king.  An alternative, probably preliminary, version of the figure on the left appears to the left and includes the right side of his body, his head, and his hat.  There is also a preliminary sketch of his left arm just above the more fully developed left arm.</illusobjdesc>
