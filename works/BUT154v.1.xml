                <note>Probably inherited by Blake's wife Catherine at his death in 1827; acquired by Frederick Tatham, probably at Catherine Blake's death in 1831; possibly the dealer Joseph Hogarth, sold from his stock, Southgate and Barrett auction, London, 7-30 June 1854, lot 5082, with 21 other works by Blake, on the twelfth evening (16s. to "Edsall," probably a dealer); Richard Johnson; sold from Johnson's collection, Platt's auction, London, 25 April 1912, lot 702 with 16 other works (&#163;11.11s. to Archibald G. B. Russell); sold Sotheby's, 28 May 1934, lot 171 with another pencil drawing (wrongly?) attributed to Blake (&#163;5.10s. to Geoffrey Keynes); bequeathed by Keynes in 1982 to the Fitzwilliam Museum and accessioned by the Fitzwilliam in 1985.</note>

This man may have just risen from a chair or throne faintly visible against the right margin of the drawing.  He may be a king.  At far left, a pair of figures&#8212;a second bearded old man and an adolescent (perhaps a page?)&#8212;stand facing right.  Between this pair and the kneeling knight, three figures appear to stand, float, or hover slightly above the other figures.  The figure on the left of this group may be holding a staff of some sort.  The central knight may petition the king on behalf of the two figures standing behind him at left.  Curving lines upper left may represent clouds or a curtain.  The fleur-de-lis lower right may not be by Blake.</illusobjdesc>

The helmet may be adorned with feathers.

                        <illusobjdesc>At far left, a pair of figures&#8212;a second bearded adult man and an adolescent (perhaps a page?)&#8212;stand facing right.  The gowned adult figure has long hair and a beard and turns his head down, perhaps to look toward the kneeling knight.  His left arm is bent at a right angle across his chest, and his right arm is by his side; he may be holding the hand of the adolescent to the left.  His left foot appears to be extended slightly behind his right suggesting a contrapposto stance.</illusobjdesc>

The younger figure, who is likely male, stands with his head slightly lowered, perhaps to look toward the knight in front of him.  His left arm is bent, and with his left, he may hold the hand of his older companion.  He may wear a gown.</illusobjdesc>
