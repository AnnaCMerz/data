            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>

Although based loosely on a wash drawing of the same title in the British Museum (Butlin R2) by Blake's brother, Robert, this relief and white-line etching is generally considered to be an original work by William Blake. The print is dated to c. 1792 in Essick page 12. For the earlier dating of c. 1787-88 given here, see Joseph Viscomi, *Blake and the Idea of the Book* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) pages 188-92. This may be one of Blake's earliest experiments in relief and white-line etching as a means for reproducing drawings.</p></objnote>

                        At least five gowned figures stand near the edge of a rocky landmass, possibly a cliff or shoreline, in the lower right corner of the composition. The leftmost figure appears to be male as he has short curly hair and some sort of facial hair, perhaps a mustache or beard. He stands with his body twisted to the right to embrace the waist of the female figure at right. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and rests on his companion's lower back; his left hand is visible just below his right, suggesting his left arm is wrapped around her body from the left. He appears to touch the female figure's thigh with his extended left pinky figure.  Like the other figures, he turns his head to look to the left.  The female figure that the leftmost figure embraces stands second from the left and faces left. She has long hair, and her wide eyes and possibly open mouth suggest fear. Her left arm is at her side but bent upward sharply with left hand raised, palm facing out.  Just above the female figure's head, slightly to the right, another head of curly hair is visible, suggesting there may be another figure standing immediately behind her.  The third figure from the left is an old male with long hair and a long beard who stands facing forward but turns to look left.  Both arms are bent just beyond 90 degrees and crossed in front of his chest where he makes fists with both hands. The figure leans or bends forward slightly.  He is embraced from behind by another male(?) figure with short curly hair who stands facing forward and left.  This figure bends his left arm at a right angle and wraps it around the waist of the older male figure. One of his legs may be extended behind him at right.  To the right of this figure, the fifth clear figure in the group stands far right.  This female(?) figure has short curly hair and faces forward with wide eyes and an open mouth.  The figure may hold a child or infant in front of her chest, like the clearly female figure in Robert Blake's drawing on which this print is based. A circular form to the right of this figure's head may suggest another figure standing behind her at right. Shadowy or cloudy darkness broken only by a lighter diagonal line or bolt of lightning (as in the drawing) fills the upper left corner of the composition.  There may be a body of water, probably the sea, lower left.

                        <illusobjdesc>At least five gowned figures stand near the edge of a rocky landmass, possibly a cliff or shoreline, in the lower right corner of the composition. The leftmost figure appears to be male as he has short curly hair and some sort of facial hair, perhaps a mustache or beard. He stands with his body twisted to the right to embrace the waist of the female figure at right. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and rests on his companion's lower back; his left hand is visible just below his right, suggesting his left arm is wrapped around her body from the left. He appears to touch the female figure's thigh with his extended left pinky figure.  He turns his head to look to the left.</illusobjdesc>

The third figure from the left is an old male figure with long hair and a long beard who stands facing forward but turns to look left. Unlike the other figures, the pupil of his depicted left eye is not visible, suggesting it may be an empty socket.  He may be blind.  Both arms are bent just beyond 90 degrees and crossed in front of his chest where he makes fists with both hands. The figure leans or bends forward slightly.  He is embraced from behind by another male(?) figure.</illusobjdesc>
