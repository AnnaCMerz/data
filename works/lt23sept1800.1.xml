                <note>Captain Frederick Butts (the grandson of the recipient) sold (c. 1906) this letter along with several other letters to W. Graham Robertson, who allowed them to be reproduced (1926) and bequeathed them in 1948 to Mr. Kerrison Preston, who gave them in 1967 to The Westminster Public Library, which has since been incorporated into the City of Westminster Archives Centre.

                    <p>Bentley (*Writings*, volume 2, page 1541) reads this letter dated 23 September 1800 as 22 September 1800 and remarks 
                        "[s]ince the letter was postmarked on its receipt in the London Post Office'SEP 23/ 1800', and since letters posted in Chichester arrived 
                        in London the next day, this letter must have been posted on 22 Sept. Presumably it was written on the day it was posted".</p>
