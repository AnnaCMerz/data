                    <illusobjdesc>Two male figures who both face forward and wear knee-length gowns stand in the center of this composition.  Both appear to have long hair and hold objects in their hands.  The figure at left may hold a harp(?) in his right hand by his side and perhaps a staff in his left, also by his side.  His companion at right bends both arms to hold a harp in front of his chest.  A few lines below and on each side of his legs may represent a landscape in which he stands.  To the immediate left of these figures, a more faintly drawn third figure sits in profile facing right and may lean against a tree trunk at left.  There may be another figure behind and to the right.  Directly below this figure there are three similar yet indeterminate forms that may suggest figures drawn horizontally, heads on the right.  In the upper right quadrant, two tree trunks(?) or pillars stand at left.  Further right a figure, drawn horizontally, stands with arms at side.  She may hold something in her(?) right arm, possibly an infant.  In the lower right corner, there is a separate scene or vignette demarcated by a rectangle inside which a single figure stands facing forward in front of what appears to be a large herd of animals, perhaps sheep, which would suggest the figure is a shepherd.  The seven vertical forms in this vignette may be tree trunks or pillars.</illusobjdesc>
