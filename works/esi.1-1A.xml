                <objnote><p>Although the figure is a close copy of an unidentified figure in Michelangelo's *Crucifixion of St. Peter* (Pauline Chapel, Vatican), the entire composition is usually credited to Blake as the designer.  The landscape setting is Blake's own invention.  This impression is in the first state of two; the title is taken from an inscription in the second state.  Blake's later pen and ink inscription lower right in this unique impression of the first state (see the Transcription) indicates that Blake based the figure on "a drawing by Salviati" (probably Francesco Rossi Salviati).  No such drawing has been traced.  Blake may have taken the figure from an engraving of Michelangelo's entire painting or the figure alone, without surrounding background, in an engraving by Nicholas Beatrizet.  The date of this first state is based on Blake's inscription added below the design in the second state: "Engraved by W Blake 1773...."  He may have printed this impression himself.</p></objnote>

                        A single male figure, identified as Joseph of Arimathea in the second state of the plate but not in this first state, faces forward and stands on rocky and sandy ground in front of a body of water, very probably the sea. He has a long beard and turns his head to look down and to the left. He wears a short tunic or gown as well as a hood-like Phrygian cap with a pointed top that falls to the left. Both arms are bent at the elbow and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, the figure grasps his left arm just above the elbow; his left hand rests on his right forearm and he appears to touch his right upper arm with a partially extended index finger. He bends forward slightly. The figure's right leg is straight while his left is bent at the knee. Several small rocks are visible to the left of his right foot.  His left foot may rest on a rock behind him or he may be stepping or walking forward. The rocky and sandy shore on which the figure stands extends behind him at right and appears to rise into a cliff. The sea extends behind the figure and to the left. There may be clouds in the sky upper left.
