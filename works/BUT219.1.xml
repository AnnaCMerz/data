                    <p>This drawing may be a rejected design for Blake's illuminated book, *The Book
                        of Thel*. The closest association with any of the published designs is with
                        the headpiece to plate 6. If that is indeed the case, then the standing
                        figure on the right might be Thel and the figure floating to the left might
                        be the Cloud. It is difficult to identify the supine figure, the two smaller
                        figures near her head, and the figure holding the hips of the standing
                        figure with any of the other characters in the poem. For another drawing
                        related to plate 6 of *The Book of Thel*, see *Sketch for "The Book of

                        right arm. The pair of smaller figures at lower left are winged. A tree

                        <illusobjdesc>A gowned female figure stands on the right side of the
                            composition facing forward. She has long, curly hair that appears
                            somewhat flame-like and stands on end in a rightward direction. Her head
                            is turned slightly down and to the left. She frowns noticeably and her
                            eyes may be closed. Her left arm is at her side, her right raised
                            horizontally. Two smaller figures accompany the female figure: one wraps
                            its arms around her hips while the second hovers near her extended right
                            arm, perhaps in an attempt to lead her. This standing figure may be
                            touching the hovering figure to the left and possibly the leg of the
                            figure enbracing her hips. If indeed this drawing is associated with
                            Blake's illuminated book, *The Book of Thel*, this standing figure may
                            be Thel.</illusobjdesc>

                            breasts, lies supine with head at left in the lower left corner of the
                            design. Her legs are extended and together; her right arm is bent but at
                            her side while her left is extended horizontally away from her body at a
                            45 degree angle. Her head is bent back and appears to be supported by
                            two smaller figures, both winged, on either side of her head. She may be
                            dead or dying.</illusobjdesc>

                            with head at left while touching or holding(?) the standing female
                            figure's extended right arm. This figure may be nude and appears to face
                            forward, though the direction of the head is unclear. It extends one arm
                            horizontally to the left and points downward toward the other figural
                            group, lower left. Its other arm may be bent. Both legs may be extended
                            and possibly bent at the knee. If indeed this drawing is associated with
                            Blake's illuminated book, *The Book of Thel*, this hovering figure may
                            be the Cloud.</illusobjdesc>
