                    <illusobjdesc>A nude female figure stands in the center of the composition flanked on both sides by a pair of nude children.  The central adult stands or walks facing forward with her head turned to the right and slightly down, looking toward the children.  She has long hair and prominent breasts. Both arms are by her sides and she holds the hand of the child closest to her on either side. Her right leg appears to be slightly bent and lifted, as if she is stepping or walking forward. This figure may be a personification of Charity. The two nude children on the right side of the composition stand or walk facing forward.  The rightmost child appears to be female as she has long hair.  Her left arm (not clearly pictures below the elbow) may be raised horizontally and bent in front of her chest while she embraces her companion's shoulders with her extended right arm.  She may touch the hand of the adult female figure with her right hand as well. Her right leg is slightly bent and lifted as if she is stepping forward.  The gender of the second child from the right is unclear, though he(?) appears to have short hair. He faces forward but turns his head up and to the left to look toward the adult figure whose hand he holds with his raised right arm. His left leg is extended behind him as if he is walking forward.  The two children on the left side of the composition embrace each other.  The leftmost male child faces forward but twists to the right to embrace his companion with his raised right arm.  He appears to have curly hair and his genitals are pictured. His right leg is extended backward as if he is walking forward.  The second figure from the left, who may be female, faces forward but turns her head to the left, perhaps to touch the head of the figure beside her.  Her mouth is open.  With her raised left arm, she holds the right hand of the adult female figure.  Her right leg is bent and she may walk forward.</illusobjdesc>
