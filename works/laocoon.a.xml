          <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> Copy A from the Fitzwilliam Museum. This copy joins Copy B, published in the Archive in October 1998. These are the only extant impressions of this important etching/engraving.  
      <lb/>
                <lb/>In an inscription beneath his detailed reproduction of the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>, Blake reinterprets the famous Hellenistic sculpture as a copy of an original Hebraic work representing Jehovah and his two sons, Satan and Adam. Other inscriptions surrounding the central design set forth Blake’s interrelated opinions on money, empire, morality, Christianity, and the arts. The central image of the statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 in connection with Blake’s work on illustrations for Abraham Rees, <hi rend="i">The Cyclopaedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature</hi>. Blake’s careful pencil drawing of the sculptural group, based on a plaster cast in the Royal Academy, Somerset House, can be dated to 1815. <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> was not published in The <hi rend="i">Cyclopaedia</hi>, possibly because it was too large to fit into Rees’s volumes, but the copperplate was evidently retained by Blake. The inscribed texts surrounding the statue were almost certainly added at a much later date, c. 1826-27; both impressions were printed at that time. There are very slight differences in inking between the two impressions, but the only significant difference is the absence in Copy A of the small touches of black wash added to Copy B. 
      <lb/>
                <lb/><hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> includes some of Blake’s final, aphoristic statements on topics central to his writings from the 1780s to the end of his life. In his journal of c. 1859-61, John Clark Strange reports on a meeting with Samuel Palmer, one of Blake’s youthful followers in his final years. Palmer showed Strange an impression of <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> (possibly Copy B) and commented that, when Blake gave him the print, Blake said “you will find my creed there” (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Records</hi>, page 726).

               <illusobjdesc>This single, separate plate is a careful reproduction of the famous
                  Hellenistic sculptural group, the Laocoön, very probably copied by Blake after the
                  plaster copy in the Royal Academy, London. The three figures are raised on a
                  plinth, with two steps above it and a wall or pedestal behind the lower bodies of
                  the figures. While the original statue represents the Trojan priest, Laocoön, and
                  his two sons, Blake has reinterpreted it as a work of Hebraic art representing
                  Jehovah and his two sons, Adam and Satan, struggling with two serpents, labeled on
                  the plate "Evil" (line 5) and "Good" (line 31). Both serpents coil around all
                  three figures; both have their mouths open and are biting Laocoön and the son on
                  the left. The central nude figure of Laocoön/God is bearded and his hair is long.
                  His mouth is slightly open and his visage expresses great pain. His genitals are
                  clearly pictured. He faces forward, with his right leg bent at the knee and his
                  left leg extended to the right. His legs are spread apart; we see between them a
                  cascade of drapery or a robe falling from the man's body. His neck is twisted so
                  that he faces up and to the left. His right arm is raised at 135 degrees; his left
                  is bent at the elbow and reaches downward. He holds the serpent of "Good" in both
                  hands. The nude, youthful son on the left struggles with the serpent of "Evil." He
                  has been identified as Adam by some scholars, but he is probably Satan (see the
                  evidence below that the other son is Adam). His hair is long; his face suggests
                  pain. His body faces forward, but his neck is twisted so that his head is bent
                  back and facing to the right. Both legs are bent at the knees. His right arm is
                  bent upward, with the fingers of his right hand spread apart above his head. His
                  left arm is bent over his body; his left hand grasps the head of the snake. A bit
                  of drapery appears below his right thigh. The youthful, muscular nude son on the
                  right has been identified as Satan by some scholars, but he is more probably Adam
                  (given the inscription of the name Lilith, Adam's legendary first wife, in Hebrew
                  under the figure's right arm and the central figure's fist). His body faces
                  forward, with his neck twisted so that his face is seen in profile to the left.
                  His mouth is slightly open and his hair is curly. He stands on his right leg; his
                  left leg is bent sharply at the knee and drawn up toward his torso. His right arm
                  is bent upward, with his raised right hand palm out and fingers spread. His left
                  arm reaches downward, with the left hand holding the serpent wrapped around his
                  left ankle. Drapery cascades over his left shoulder and reaches to the plinth near
                  his right foot (which touches the left foot of the central figure). The signature is
                  placed so that it seems to be an inscription cut into the stone
                  plinth.</illusobjdesc>

                     His mouth is slightly open and his visage expresses great pain. His genitals
                     are clearly pictured. He faces forward, with his right leg bent at the knee and
                     his left leg extended to the right. His legs are spread apart; we see between
                     them a cascade of drapery or a robe falling from the man's body. His neck is
                     twisted so that he faces up and to the left. His right arm is raised at 135
                     degrees; his left is bent at the elbow and reaches downward. He holds the
                     serpent of "Good" (line 31) in both hands and struggles with the beast as he is
                     coiled by it.</illusobjdesc>

                     long; his face suggests pain. His body faces forward, but his neck is twisted
                     so that his head is bent back and facing to the right. Both legs are bent at
                     the knees. His right arm is bent upward, with the fingers of his right hand
                     spread apart above his head. His left arm is bent over his body; his left hand
                     grasps the head of the snake as the beast coils around his legs. A bit of
                     drapery appears below his right thigh.</illusobjdesc>

                     right arm and the central figure's fist). His body faces forward, with his neck
                     twisted so that his face is seen in profile to the left. His mouth is slightly
                     open and his hair is curly. He stands on his right leg; his left leg is bent
                     sharply at the knee and drawn up toward his torso. His right arm is bent
                     upward, with his raised right hand palm out and fingers spread. His left arm
                     reaches downward, with the left hand holding the serpent wrapped around his
                     left ankle as it begins to coil around him. Drapery cascades over his left
                     shoulder and reaches to the plinth near his right foot (which touches the left
