            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
 <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access

                <note>Probably inherited from Blake by his wife Catherine upon his death in 1827; probably acquired by Frederick Tatham upon Catherine Blake's death in 1831; acquired by George A. Smith and bound by him in "about 1853" (Bentley page 337) with other works by Blake, including the manuscript "Order" of the *Songs of Innocence and of Experience*; the volume offered, presumably by Smith, at a Puttick and Simpson auction, London, 3-4 July 1863 (&#163;15.15.s., possibly bought-in by Smith given the reappearance of the volume in the Smith auction of 1880); the volume offered by the dealer Bernard Quaritch, 1864 *Catalogue of Books*, item 6521, possibly on consignment from, or in partnership with, Smith (&#163;21); the volume sold by Smith, Christie's, 1 April 1880, lot 168 (&#163;66 to Quaritch); the volume apparently lent by Quaritch to William Muir, who used some works as the basis for his facsimiles; the volume offered by Quaritch, Oct. 1883 *Catalogue of Works on the Fine Arts*, item 10,252 (&#163;80), May 1885 catalogue, *William Blake's Original Drawings*, page 2, no item number (&#163;80), and 1887 *General Catalogue of Books*, volume 2, item 10,252 (&#163;80); the volume acquired by Bernard Buchanan Macgeorge between 1892 and 1906; the volume sold from the Macgeorge collection, Sotheby's, 1 July 1924, lot 133 (&#163;345 to the dealer E. Parsons &#38; Sons); the volume, possibly with some leaves removed, offered by Maggs Bros., 1924 catalogue 456, item 53 (&#163;630); the volume acquired no later than 1927 by George C. Smith who disbound the volume; this print sold from George C. Smith's collection, Parke-Bernet, 2 Nov. 1938, lot 24 ($800 to the dealer A. S. W. Rosenbach acting for Lessing J. Rosenwald); given by Rosenwald to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., in 1943.</note>

                    <illusobjdesc>This experimental relief plate has three main sections. The upper portion of the plate depicts a nude male figure who faces forward and is visible from the shoulders down. The figure may sit on a small mound or kneel on his bent right knee. His left leg is bent and in front of his body. The figure's arms are bent. The figure appears to grasp a severed human head that faces up and right with his left hand at right. With his right hand, the figure may grasp an indeterminate mass of objects visible beside him at left. A bird with outstretched wings flies in the upper left corner of the design, and an indeterminate form is visible below and right of the bird. A cat is visible below the severed head at right. Lines and other forms on the ground below the figure may indicate grass or other vegetation. Additional indeterminate vegetation may be visible above the figure's hand at right. Tightly cross-hatched lines to the right of the figure's torso may suggest a dark background sky. The middle section of the plate is smaller than the surrounding designs and depicts a series of geometric and linear designs. The top row of designs includes a triangle at left, a circle at center, and a square at right, as well as several linear forms in between and around the row. A semi-circular line surrounds the lower portion of the middle section. Both straight and squiggled lines are visible inside the semi-circle. Like the upper portion, the third, lowest portion of the plate depicts a nude male figure who faces forward and is visible from the shoulders down. The figure appears to sit on grassy ground or kneel on his right knee; his body is twisted or bent to the left. His left leg is bent forward. His right arm is bent and at his side with his left hand braced against the ground at left. His left arm is bent at a right angle and his left hand is also braced on the ground or a rock at right. Below his left hand, two severed heads that face forward are visible in the lower right corner. Additional indeterminate vegetation may be visible above the figure's hand at right. Horizontal lines to the left and right of the figure's torso may suggest beams of light in a background sky.</illusobjdesc>
