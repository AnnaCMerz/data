                    <illusobjdesc>The design features two male figures. At left is an old man who represents the Ghost of Samuel. He has a long beard, and he may wear a robe. He has long hair or, alternatively, may wear a hat. Only the upper half of his body is visible; he may be sitting or floating. Samuel faces forward with his eyes downcast. His right arm is at his side and may be bent. He raises his left arm at 135 degrees and holds his palm vertically to face the figure of Saul on the right. The Saul figure at right has short, curly hair. He faces left toward Samuel's ghost and kneels with his lower legs propped on his flexed feet. Between his bent knees and his hunched shoulders, his body is rigidly vertical. He bends forward at the shoulders and holds his arms stiffly downward at his sides or in front of his torso. He clenches his hands into fists and looks angrily, with brow furrowed, toward Samuel. Curved pencil lines suggest a cloud surrounding Samuel, and blue coloring may suggest sky. Above the cloud is a penciled orb that may represent the sun. Washes in the lower righthand corner of the image, beneath Saul, suggest that he may be kneeling on a bank. A shadow extends along the length of the lower border and darkens in the lower righthand corner.</illusobjdesc>

He has a long beard and may have long hair or wear a hat. Only the upper half of his body is visible, so he may sit on an earthen bank or float above it in the cloud that appears behind him. Samuel faces forward with his eyes downcast. His right arm is at his side and may be bent. He raises his left arm at 135 degrees and holds his palm vertically, facing toward the figure of Saul on the right. Lines across Samuel's left arm may indicate a robe, and blue coloring on Samuel's body suggests his specter-like nature. Pencil lines radiate from below his right shoulder and under his raised left arm.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The design features two male figures. The figure at right is a younger, nude man who represents Saul. He has short, curly hair that may stand on end near the crown of his head. He faces left and looks toward Samuel's ghost and kneels with legs together and his lower legs propped on his flexed feet. His body forms a near right angle. Between his bent knees and his hunched shoulders, his body is rigidly vertical. He bends forward at the shoulders and holds his arms stiffly downward at his sides or in front of his torso. His hands are clenched into fists. His facial expression, and particularly his eyes and furrowed brow, suggests anger.</illusobjdesc>
