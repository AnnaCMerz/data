                        Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right.  The rightmost figure is nude with prominent genitals. He has short curly hair and turns his head to look to the left. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. Both arms are bent and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, he holds the haft of a sword, which is pointed upward. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. To his left, the middle figure turns his head to look forward.  He has long hair, a mustache, and a beard; he also wears a spiky crown.  He may be a king. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth are visible. He raises both bent arms upward and clutches his head with both hands. The fingers of both hands appear to be curled inward. This figure wears a cape or cloak that extends behind his thighs. He may also wear a sleeved shirt or breastplate. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. The leftmost figure stands with his body facing right and head turned to look left. He has short wavy hair that stands on end and a large mustache; he may also have a beard. He wears a shirt composed of small circles, which may indicate chain mail, and pleated breeches or skirt(?). His costume suggests that of a Roman soldier. His right arm appears to be raised and extended behind the figure to his right. He may hold the spear visible above the middle figure's head. Only the right leg and foot of the leftmost figure are visible. The three figures stand between two wooden vertical objects, which may a door frame, as there appears to be a small horizontal step behind the figures' feet. The ground on which they stand may also be made of wood. Above their heads in the background is a sky with clouds.

                        <illusobjdesc>Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right. The middle figure turns his head to look forward.  He has long hair, a mustache, and a beard; he also wears a spiky crown.  He may be a king. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth are visible. He raises both bent arms upward and clutches his head with both hands. The fingers of both hands appear to be curled inward. This figure wears a cape or cloak that extends behind his thighs. He may also wear a sleeved shirt or breastplate. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. Lines under his feet hint at sandals, but no straps are pictured.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right. The leftmost figure stands with his body facing right and head turned to look left. He has short wavy hair that stands on end and a large mustache; he may also have a beard. He wears a shirt composed of small circles, which may indicate chain mail, and pleated breeches or skirt(?).  His costume suggests that of a Roman soldier. His right arm appears to be raised and extended behind the figure to his right. He may hold the spear visible above the middle figure's head. Only the right leg and foot of the leftmost figure are visible. Lines under his foot hint at a sandal, but no straps are pictured.</illusobjdesc>
