                    <illusobjdesc>Seven figures stand or dance in a grassy landscape at night in
                        this design that represents the final scene in Shakespeare's play <hi
                            rend="i">A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>. Two figures with blonde hair
                        stand beside the left margin. Facing right, the male figure at left has
                        short curly hair, a beard, and a mustache. He wears a spiky crown and a long
                        gown with additional drapery, probably a cloak, visible behind him. His left
                        leg is bent and crossed over his right. His right arm is slightly bent and
                        by his side. A staff and flower (perhaps a lily) are visible near his right
                        hand, though it seems more likely that these are held by his female
                        companion, whose left arm is wrapped around his body. This figure has long
                        hair and wears a headband or perhaps a diadem(?) as well as a long gown. She
                        faces forward but turns her head to look down and to the right as she leans
                        against her male companion at left. Her right leg is visibly bent beneath
                        her gown. This pair is Oberon, king of the Fairies, and Titania, queen of
                        the fairies, who together lead the other fairies in song and dance at the
                        end of the play. To the right of this pair, a male figure, nude from the
                        waist up, faces forward and looks toward the pair at left with a smile. He
                        has short brown hair and wears knee-length pants or breeches. Blue leaves
                        decorate his hair and waist; he also wears a necklace or ribbon tied around
                        his neck. With elbows bent, he raises both arms vertically and appears to
                        hold small instruments around the ring fingers of each hand, possibly
                        castanets or finger cymbals. His left palm faces forward while he touches
                        his thumb to his other fingers with the other hand. Both legs are bent with
                        the right extended forward, perhaps to suggest dancing. This figure is Puck,
                        also known as Robin Goodfellow, who is a hobgoblin in Oberon's service. Puck
                        acts as a wise yet mischievous character throughout the play, and he states
                        the final lines of the play: "So good night unto you all./ Give me your
                        hands, if we be friends,/ And Robin shall restore amends (Act 5, Scene 1,
                        453-5). On the right side of the scene, four figures (who may all be
                        female?) dance and hold hands in a circle. These are likely the other
                        fairies in the trains of Titania and Oberon. The leftmost figure in the
                        group faces right and wears a gown as well as a decorative headdress that
                        resembles butterfly wings. Her hair is either short or arranged in a bun.
                        She leans forward but also twists her body to raise her left arm vertically,
                        where she touches her companion with her left hand, and extend her bent
                        right arm forward to hold the hand of her other companion at right. Her left
                        leg is extended backward as she appears to move in a clockwise direction.
                        The next figure clockwise to her right faces forward but looks left and back
                        toward her companion. She also wears a long gown that includes a circular
                        flourish of fabric behind her back. Red petal-like objects adorn her head as
                        her long hair streams to the left. She raises both bent arms horizontally
                        with palms facing upward to touch the hands of her companions on either
                        side. Her right leg is extended to the left as she moves in a clockwise
                        direction. The third dancer at far right is the least distinct, though
                        she(?) also wears a gown and has leafy decorations in her short hair and
                        perhaps also around her waist. This figure faces right but turns her head to
                        look left; her mouth may be slightly open. Both arms are extended (though
                        the majority of the left is not visible), and she holds the hand of her
                        companion at left. Her left leg is extended backward. Immediately in front
                        of this figure, a disconnected arm is visible emerging from the right margin
                        of the design to hold the right hand of the final figure, which suggests the
                        complete circle of dancers contains five rather than four figures. The fully
                        visible fourth figure, however, faces left and leans forward with right leg
                        bent and left leg extended backward. She(?) wears a knee-length skirt and,
                        like the figure behind her, has leafy foliage decorating her short hair and
                        extending down her back. She extends her right arm backward to hold the
                        otherwise disembodied arm and her left forward to touch the first dancer at
                        left. The nighttime landscape in which these figures stand includes grassy
                        ground, overhead leaves and vines, and perhaps the trunks of trees upper
                        right and left. There are stars in the sky. A shadowy circle appears on the
                        ground below the dancers. This is probably Blake's imaginative version of a
                        fairy ring.</illusobjdesc>

                            he may be a king) and a long gown with additional drapery (probably a
                            cloak) visible behind him. His left leg is bent and crossed over his
                            right. His right arm is slightly bent and by his side. A staff and
                            flower are visible near his right hand, though it seems more likely that
                            these are held by his female companion, whose left arm is wrapped around
                            his body. He appears to look toward the scene of dancing in front of him
                            at right. This figure is Oberon, king of the Fairies, who with his wife
                            Titania, queen of the fairies, lead the other fairies in song and dance
                            at the end of the play.</illusobjdesc>

                            faces forward but turns her head to look down and to the right as she
                            leans against and embraces her male companion at left. It is likely that
                            she holds in her left hand the staff or scepter and flower that are

                            with a smile. He has short brown hair and wears knee-length breeches.
                            Blue flowers decorate his hair and waist; he also wears a necklace or
                            ribbon tied around his neck with a loose knot. With elbows bent, he
                            raises both arms vertically and appears to hold small musical
                            instruments around the ring fingers of each hand, possibly castanets or
                            finger cymbals. His left palm faces forward while he touches his thumb
                            to his other fingers with the other hand. Both legs are bent with the
                            right extended forward, perhaps to suggest dancing. This figure is Puck,
                            also known as Robin Goodfellow, who is a hobgoblin in Oberon's service.
                            Puck acts as a wise yet mischievous character throughout the play, and
                            he states the final lines of the play: "So good night unto you all./
                            Give me your hands, if we be friends,/ And Robin shall restore amends

                            (though the majority of the left is not visible), and she holds the hand
                            of her companion at left. Her left leg is extended
                            backward.</illusobjdesc>

                            figures (who may all be female?) dance and hold hands in a circle. These
                            are likely the other fairies in the trains of Titania and Oberon. In the
                            lower right corner of the scene, the fourth figure faces left and leans
                            forward with right leg bent to stand on tiptoe and left leg extended
                            backward. She(?) wears a knee-length skirt and, like the figure behind
                            her, has leafy foliage decorating her short hair and extending down her
                            back. She extends her right arm backward to hold the otherwise
                            disembodied arm and her left forward to touch the first dancer at
