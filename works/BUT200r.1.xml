                    <illusobjdesc>Two groups of figures constitute this sketch.  At left, at least two (perhaps three) figures form a triangular arrangement of overlapping bodies.  The tallest leans diagonally to the right and appears to stretch its right arm in the same direction.  This may be Tiriel.  He may wear a hat or hood or have long hair.  This figure may wear a gown and may support a second figure in the foreground who crouches or sits facing away from the viewer.  This may be Tiriel's wife, Myratana.  This figure's right arm may be outstretched to the right.  Directly above this figure's arm, what may be a nude torso of a third figure is visible.  On the right side of the composition, at least three figures stand facing forward and left.  These are probably Tiriel's sons.  The leftmost of these wears a gown and has short(?) hair.  His left arm is bent at the elbow, and he holds an indeterminate object in his left hand.  His right arm is extended vertically with right hand possibly clasped in a fist.  To the right of this figure, a second figure who appears to wear a crown and gown also bends his left arm at the elbow.  The head of a third figure is visible at far right, and though this figure is the least detailed, it too may have its left arm bent at the elbow.  There are other lines and forms across the composition, but the significance of these is impossible to determine.  The scene is likely connected with the monochrome wash drawing, <hi rend="i">Tiriel Supporting the Dying Myratana and Cursing His Sons</hi> (Butlin 198.1), an illustration to Blake's manuscript poem, <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>.</illusobjdesc>
