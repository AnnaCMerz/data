            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt><updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of
twenty-seven water color drawings produced by Blake between 1775 and c. 1790.
Blake’s activities as a water colorist from the mid-1770s through the next decade reveal
his increasing skills in that medium, ranging from apprentice work to original
compositions exhibited at the Royal Academy. Assignments from his engraving
instructor, James Basire, included the precise copying of tomb monuments in
Westminster Abbey (Objects 1-5). These water colors were later engraved, probably with
Blake’s assistance, as illustrations for Joseph Ayloffe’s Account of Some Ancient
Monuments in Westminster Abbey (1780), republished in volume 2 of the Society of
Antiquaries’ Vetusta Monumenta (c. 1789). This early contact with Gothic art
profoundly affected Blake’s later work as an artist and his writings on the history of art.
Shortly after his release from apprenticeship in 1779, Blake began to develop a series of
designs picturing major events in the history of England (Objects 7-12). He exhibited
one of these, The Death of Earl Goodwin (Object 9) or a more finished version of the
design, at the Royal Academy in 1780. This group of pictures may have culminated in
“The History of England, a small book of Engravings,” advertised in Blake’s prospectus
To the Public in October 1793. Unfortunately, no copy of that work has ever been
recorded. Blake developed at least one work in this series, Pestilence, Probably the
Great Plague of London (Object 12), into a slightly larger and more finished water color
(Object 14). Lear and Cordelia was probably executed as part of the history of England
series but is presented in the Archive under Water Color Drawings, Illustrations to
Shakespeare.
Blake’s early water colors include several designs with biblical subjects (Objects 6, 13,
15, 18, 20-23, 27). The most highly finished and important of these are three illustrations
to the story of Joseph and his brethren recounted in Genesis (Objects 20, 22, 23). These
were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785. One year earlier, Blake’s A Breach in a
City, the Morning after the Battle (object 19), had appeared at the same venue. Blake
was trying, by the mid-1780s, to establish his reputation as a “history” painter—that is, as
a specialist in themes taken from history, the Bible, and canonical literary texts such as
Milton’s Paradise Lost. In the eighteenth century, such subjects were believed to be
appropriate for the greatest artistic ambitions, but all of Blake’s exhibited works were in
water colors rather than the more highly regarded medium of oil painting.
Almost all of Blake’s water colors fit comfortably within the long tradition of water color
drawing, in which one delineates form by line and the tinting is confined within firm
outlines. Water color painting, a style developed by artists such as J. M. W. Turner,
allowed for a freer use of washes, unconfined by pen and ink or pencil boundaries and
without underlying washes laid in for modeling.

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In an outdoor setting framed by trees and a low fence sit three figures: an old man (presumably Age) and a young woman (Youth) in similar white garments, and another woman in a colorful gown who sits before them, nearer the viewer. The man sits in a high-backed chair decorated by bevelled corners. He has short, curly, white hair and a full beard, and he wears a long-sleeved white gown that extends to the ground and mostly covers his feet. He may wear sandals, or his visible right foot may rest on part of the gown's hem. His prominent right knee faces the viewer, but the rest of his body twists to the right as he spreads his legs and points his bent left knee toward the center of the design. His shoulders hunch forward as he extends his slightly bent arms downward to hold a large book out in front of his torso, facing the young woman next to him. His head faces right and down, and he may gaze downward at the book or at the girl who reads it. The title suggests that he is teaching her. Similarly clad in a long-sleeved gown, the young woman appears to sit at the base of a tree (and may lean against it). Her torso faces the viewer and leans slightly toward the book at her right; her lower body is obscured by another figure. Her head is held high and faces to the left as her eyes glance downward at the large book. Her long, white hair flows down her back, perhaps gathered into a ponytail at the back of her head. The young woman's left arm extends toward the right edge of the design and bends upward, revealing a bracelet or decorative border at her wrist. She holds her hand high with her thumb and index finger pointed upward, and the rest of her fingers gather into a fist. She is presumably the student in this scene and may be reading Age's book. The third figure differs from Age and Youth with her bright, multi-colored garment and short, curly, blond hair. Her long-sleeved gown appears to bear a floral pattern; it falls to the top of her knees and is gathered at the waist with a belt. This second woman sits on a low, four-legged stool, facing left with her bent legs extended outward and crossed at the ankles, right over left. Her back forms a C-curve as she hunches over a book or pad of paper. Her left arm bends upward as she holds the edge of the paper in her left hand. Her right arm extends along her lap and grasps the quill or pen with which she appears to write. The woman leans downward with her neck and chin extended as she looks at the paper. Her visible left eye seems half closed, and her facial expression suggests seriousness or focus. Grass covers the ground in the lower portion of the design. Immediately behind the three figures are two nearly identical trees, one rising behind the center of the man's chair and the other behind the woman on the stool. They have narrow, branchless trunks with multi-colored bark suggesting that they may be birch trees. Their leaves are vaguely defined with large areas of tan and bluish-green merging to create a canopy at the top of the design. At least three more trees appear in the background; the center tree has several thin branches that reach upward into cloud-like leaves. Separating these two sets of trees is a low fence made of painted wood. Several sections of narrow vertical slats are joined by wider beams along the top and sides. Low shrubs may line the area in front of this fence. In the design's background, the sky is formed of blue and orange washes, suggesting sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Similarly clad in a long-sleeved gown, a young woman (presumably Youth) appears to sit at the base of a tree and may lean against it. Her torso faces the viewer and leans slightly toward the book at her right; her lower body is obscured by another figure. Her head is held high and faces to the left as her eyes glance downward at the large book. Her long, white hair flows down her back, perhaps gathered into a ponytail at the back of her head. The young woman's left arm extends toward the right edge of the design and bends upward, revealing a bracelet or decorative border at her wrist. She holds her hand high with her thumb and index finger pointed upward, and the rest of her fingers gather into a fist. She is presumably the student in this scene and may be reading the book held by Age.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The third figure differs from Age and Youth with her bright, multi-colored garment and short, curly, blond hair. Her long-sleeved gown appears to bear a flower, branch, and leaf pattern; it falls to the top of her knees and is gathered at the waist with a belt. This second woman sits in a contracted position on a low, four-legged stool, facing left with her bent legs extended outward and crossed at the ankles, right over left. Her back forms a C-curve as she hunches over a book or pad of paper. Her left arm bends upward as she holds the edge of the paper in her left hand. Her right arm extends along her lap and grasps the quill or pen with which she appears to write. The woman leans downward with her neck and chin extended as she looks at the paper. Her visible left eye seems half closed, and her facial expression suggests seriousness or focus.</illusobjdesc>

At least three trees of a different variety appear in the background; the center tree has several thin branches that reach upward into cloud-like leaves.</illusobjdesc>
