                    <illusobjdesc>Two vertical lines in the center of the drawing divide the
                        compositional space into two seemingly unrelated halves. At right, a bearded
                        and gowned man with long hair sits in a chair facing forward. His bent left
                        arm rests on the arm of the chair (obscured by his drapery), and he points
                        down with the index finger of his left hand. His right arm is extended and
                        his right hand rests on his left knee; the index finger of his right hand is
                        extended down and to the right. Both legs are bent and spread. An object
                        whose significance is indeterminate is visible below his right foot. In the
                        scene at left, four figures sit and stand around a table. The rightmost
                        figure is an adult woman with long curly hair wearing a gown and veil who
                        sits in a chair. Facing forward, she bends her left arm upward to hold a
                        distaff and her right arm is bent and raised across her torso; she holds the
                        material she is spinning with both hands. The spindle(?) to which the
                        material is still attached rests on the table in front of her. Beside the
                        female figure at left, a smaller male figure, perhaps a child or adolescent
                        depicted from the waist up, is visible. He has short curly hair and wears a
                        long-sleeved shirt. Both of his arms rest on the table, and he appears to
                        rest his head on his raised right hand. A second smaller male figure stands
                        in the foreground, across the table from his companions, facing right. He
                        has short curly hair and wears a shirt with tights or breeches. His bent
                        left arm rests on the table and his right is at his side, slightly bent. He
                        stands in contrapposto with left leg extended backward, heel raised. Visible
                        from the shoulders up, the leftmost figure of the group is an adult male
                        figure with a beard. He faces right and wears a hat with a ribbon. This
                        group may be a family with a father, mother, and two male children. The
                        table around which they sit is round with one visible serpentine leg. Two
                        tall arched openings that may be doors or windows are visible in the right
                        side of the wall behind the group at left. Framing lines extend around three
                        sides of the composition and include the seated figure far
                        right.</illusobjdesc>
