            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a
                digital edition of forty-three pencil drawings produced by Blake during his first
                decade as an independent artist, 1779-1790. Drawing lies at the core of Blake's life
                as an artist. Pencil was his preferred medium for sketching—more flexible, less
                expensive, and more easily corrected than pen and ink or chalk. Preliminary work
                with the pencil preceded more finished work, either as separate sketches for prints
                and paintings or as drawings underlying water colors. Blake's nineteenth-century
                writings on the arts testify to his conviction that drawing was fundamental to all
                pictorial expression: "The distinction that is made in modern times between a
                Painting and a Drawing proceeds from ignorance of art. The merit of a Picture is the
                same as the merit of a Drawing" (*A Descriptive Catalogue*, Erdman page 549); "Let a
                Man who has made a Drawing go on &amp; on &amp; he will produce a Picture or Painting but if
                he chooses to leave off before he has spoild it he will Do a Better Thing[.]"
                (*Public Address*, Erdman page 576); "Painting is Drawing on Canvas &amp; Engraving is
                Drawing on Copper &amp; Nothing Else…&amp; he who Draws best must be the best Artist…."
                (*Public Address*, Erdman page 582); "Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather
                madness, for I am really drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or
                graver into my hand…." (letter to William Hayley, 1804, Erdman page 757). <lb/>
                <lb/> Blake no doubt executed a great many more pencil drawings than those extant
                today. Sketches were not intended for exhibition or sale; most were probably
                discarded, while others may have been retained only because of more developed
                compositions on the other side of the leaves. Even the slightest and least
                aesthetically ambitious drawings offer insights into the origins and earliest
                realizations of Blake’s designs. These first thoughts on paper often tell us more
                about Blake’s habits of mind, when joined by eye and hand, than more finished works.
                Sketches are “the first fruits of [Blake’s] imagination,” as Geoffrey Keynes states
                in the introduction to his *Pencil Drawings of William Blake* (1927). <lb/>
                <lb/> The forty-three pencil drawings presented here, produced in Blake’s first
                decade as an independent artist, show his early debt to academic standards of
                precise copying and to the neoclassical emphasis on outline. The first four works
                may have been drawn while Blake was a student in the Royal Academy schools. Other
                sketches are preliminaries for some of Blake’s most important designs. Among these
                are the *Study for “Glad Day”, or “Albion Rose”* ( Object 6), Blake’s iconic vision
                of the human form divine in energetic pose, and three sketches (Objects 34-36) for
                illustrations to *Tiriel*, the only group of finished drawings Blake composed for
                one of his own poems. Several sketches are early efforts at picturing events in the
                Bible, Blake’s main inspiration for designs throughout his life. This biblical
                cluster includes *The Resurrection of the Dead* (Object 10), *Samuel Presenting Saul
                to the People* (Object 15), and *Job’s Wife and Other Sketches* (Object 31). Other
                studies, such as *Ugolino in Prison* and its verso (Objects 21-22), reveal the
                beginnings of subjects also of lifelong interest for Blake. Only a few drawings for
                Blake’s illuminated books have survived, but studies such as *Sketches for “The Book
                of Thel”* and *A Standing and a Recumbent Figure* (Objects 37-39) offer fascinating
                glimpses into Blake’s methods of graphic production and revision. <lb/>

                    <illusobjdesc>This drawing shows the resurrection of the dead (Revelation 20). A
                        trumpeting figure flies or hovers in the upper half of the drawing above
                        several figures, all visible from approximately the waist up, some of whom
                        raise their arms upward in this resurrection scene. These figures may emerge
                        from the ground or a body of water (see "the sea gave up the dead,"
                        Revelation 20:13). The above figure appears to fly in from the right and
                        face forward. It may wear a gown; both arms are raised horizontally and
                        extended to hold the end of a trumpet into which the figure blows. Lines
                        emerging from the musical instrument may indicate sound or, alternatively,
                        suggest surrounding clouds. In the lower right quadrant, a group of at least
                        five figures huddle together. The leftmost of these appears to be a woman
                        (perhaps with long hair arranged in a bun?) who faces right with eyes
                        raised. She holds a short-haired infant or child who raises its bent right
                        arm at approximately 135 degrees. Directly to the right of the female
                        figure's head, an adult male's head is visible also facing right and up. He
                        has short hair and may reach his right arm around the female at left,
                        resting his hand on her right shoulder. A fourth, smaller figure (perhaps a
                        child or adolescent?) is visible directly below the male's head; this figure
                        faces right, perhaps with eyes closed, and raises its left arm at 135
                        degrees. The rightmost figure in this group is the least clear but a head
                        and shoulders appear to be visible behind and to the right of the adult
                        male. To the left of this group in the bottom center of the drawing, a pair
                        of nude male figures, one in front of the other, raise their arms vertically
                        with fingers spread. Like the figures to their right, they face right and
                        up. The mouth of the figure closer to the viewer is open, and he appears to
                        have a beard. There may be a third group of figures in the lower left
                        quadrant but the details of these figures are indistinct.</illusobjdesc>

                            figures below. He(?) may wear a gown. Both arms are raised horizontally
                            and extended to hold the end of a trumpet into which the figure
