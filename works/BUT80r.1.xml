                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, a standing figure seen from behind appears to look down on another figure who supports himself on the ground with his right arm and leg.  Both figures carry round shields and thus may be soldiers; the kneeling figure was likely just defeated.  The central, standing figure may hold the hilt of a sword behind his back in his lowered right hand.  Near the right edge of the drawing, a female(?) figure wearing a long gown stands facing forward and looks left.  With both arms bent over her torso, she appears to hold or lead the horse at right that also faces forward.  Above the kneeling soldier at left, a group of three figures who are drawn indistinctly stand behind what may be a wall or barrier extending across the scene horizontally.  Additional indeterminate forms in the upper left quadrant may suggest tree trunks and perhaps hills.</illusobjdesc>

The upright figure who faces away and slightly left stands or walks with his left foot extended backward.  He wears a short cloak with a hood and a hat and carries or holds a round shield.  He may hold the hilt of a sword behind his back in his lowered right hand.  It is likely that this figure is a soldier who just defeated the similarly armed reclining figure.</illusobjdesc>

The semi-reclining figure faces forward and right with head turned up and eyes closed.  He appears to have short hair and perhaps a beard.  With his left arm he holds or carries a round shield; his bent right arm is braced with his hand on the ground.  He kneels on his bent right knee while his left is extended backward.  It is likely that this figure is a soldier just defeated by the similarly armed standing figure.</illusobjdesc>
