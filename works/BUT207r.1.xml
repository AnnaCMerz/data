                <objnote><p>The pen and ink inscription below the design is attributed to Frederick Tatham in Butlin 207.  The inscription lower right, "8763.B," is the Victoria and Albert Museum accession number written by a curator, probably c. 1881.  See also the verso of this leaf, <hi rend="i">Head of a Man and Small Head of Ugolino</hi>, Butlin 207 verso.  This recto pencil sketch is closely related to a monochrome wash drawing of approximately the same date, <hi rend="i">Ugolino: "Does Thy God, O Priest, Take Such Vengeance as This?"</hi>, Butlin 208.  Blake executed several similar designs based on the subject of Ugolino in prison with his sons and grandsons, including a pencil sketch in his Notebook, Butlin 201.59; <hi rend="i">For Children: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, Bentley plate 14; <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</hi>, Bentley plate 14; <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, Bentley plate 16; <hi rend="i">Ugolino and His Sons in Prison</hi> among the Dante water colors, Butlin 812.68; and the tempera painting, <hi rend="i">Count Ugolino and His Sons in Prison</hi>, Butlin 805.  The present sketch is not a direct preliminary drawing for any of these later works.</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>In a rectangular composition positioned against the right margin of the leaf, five figures sit in what appears to be the dark interior space of a prison.  The central figure is Ugolino, a gowned male with curly hair standing on end and a beard.  He sits cross-legged facing forward.  His arms are at his sides.  His facial expression suggests fear, despair, or madness.  The other figures are his sons and grandsons.  The rightmost figure, a nude male with long hair, sits or leans against a wall facing left with left arm by his side, hand clenched in a fist.  His extended legs touch those of his companion at far left; his left ankle may be shackled.  He turns his head up in a gesture that suggests despair.  The second figure from the right sits with legs drawn up facing forward against the rear wall.  He has long hair and may wear a gown.  With arms by his sides, he turns his head up and to the left, perhaps to look toward the central figure.  The second figure from the left, a nude(?) male with long hair, sits with legs drawn up facing forward and looking right, likely toward the central figure.  His right arm is by his side with hand braced on the ground.  The fifth and leftmost figure sits or leans against a wall facing right with head turned down and eye closed.  He may wear a gown.  His right arm is visible by his side with open palm braced on the ground, and his extended legs touch those of his companion at far right.  Behind the central figure, several horizontal lines suggest a heavy, barred door in this prison.  The diagonal shading of the interior walls indicates the darkness of the space.</illusobjdesc>
