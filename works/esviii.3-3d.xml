Fragments of the second state inscriptions are visible left of the signature below the design ("When") and right of the penultimate line below the design (the upper part of the "P" of "Page").  This impression is inscribed "F.K." (Frederick Keppel) in pen and ink lower left and "Designed and Engraved by William Blake" in pencil just above the bottom edge of the leaf.  Neither inscription is by Blake and they are not shown here.</p></objnote>

                        Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right.  The inscription above their heads identifies them as accusers, but the inscription below the design identifies them (reading from left to right?) as the "Accuser," the "Judge," and the "Executioner."  The rightmost figure wears a shirt, breeches, and a laurel crown. He has short curly hair and turns his head to look to the left. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth are visible. Both arms are bent and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, he holds the haft of a sword, which is pointed upward. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left.  In the inscription about the figures, he is identified as the accuser of murder. To his left, the middle figure turns his head to look forward.  He has long hair, a mustache, and a beard; he also wears a spiky crown. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth and tongue are visible. He raises both bent arms upward and clutches his head with both hands. The fingers of both hands appear to be curled inward. This figure wears a cloak that extends down behind his thighs. He may also wear a shirt and breeches(?). His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. In the inscription about the figures, he is identified as the accuser of adultery. The leftmost figure stands with his body facing right and head turned to look left and slightly down. He has short hair that stands on end, a mustache, and a beard. He wears a shirt composed of small circles, which may indicate chain mail, and pleated breeches or skirt(?).  His costume suggests that of a Roman soldier. His right arm appears to be raised and extended behind the figure to his right. He may hold the spear pointed upward above the middle figure's head with his left hand (which is not visible). Only the right leg and foot of the leftmost figure are visible. In the inscription about the figures, he is identified as the accuser of theft.  Lines below the feet of all three figures suggest sandals, but no straps are pictured. Three tall flames frame the group of figures at right and left. Behind the flames on both sides of the composition are two wooden vertical objects, which may be a door frame, as there appears to be a small horizontal step behind the figures' feet. The ground on which they stand may also be made of wood. Above their heads in the background is sky that may contain wispy clouds.

                        <illusobjdesc>Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right. The inscription above their heads identifies them as accusers, but the inscription below the design identifies them (reading from left to right?) as the "Accuser," the "Judge," and the "Executioner." The middle figure, possibly the judge, turns his head to look forward.  He has long hair, a mustache, and a beard; he also wears a spiky crown. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth and tongue are visible. He raises both bent arms upward and clutches his head with both hands. The fingers of both hands appear to be curled inward. This figure wears a cloak that extends down behind his thighs. He may also wear a shirt and breeches(?). His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. Lines below his feet suggest sandals, but no straps are pictured. In the inscription about the figures, he is identified as the accuser of adultery.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right. The inscription above their heads identifies them as accusers, but the inscription below the design identifies them (reading from right to left?) as the "Accuser," the "Judge," and the "Executioner." The leftmost figure, possibly the executioner, stands with his body facing right and head turned to look left and slightly down. He has short hair that stands on end, a mustache, and a beard. He wears a shirt composed of small circles, which may indicate chain mail, and pleated breeches or skirt(?).  His costume suggests that of a Roman soldier. His right arm appears to be raised and extended behind the figure to his right. He may hold the spear pointed upward above the middle figure's head with his left hand (which is not visible). Only the right leg and foot of the leftmost figure are visible.  Lines below his foot suggest a sandal, but no straps are pictured. In the inscription about the figures, he is identified as the accuser of theft.</illusobjdesc>
