                    given the reappearance of the volume in the Smith auction of 1880); the volume

                    <illusobjdesc>In this print, two figures stand above a supine figure against
                        what may be a background of flames. Lying supine with his head at left near
                        the lower edge of the composition, a nude male figure bends his head back
                        and opens his mouth widely. He may look up toward the standing figures
                        above. He has short hair and an area of flames(?) may encircle his head.
                        Both arms are extended outward from his body with his left arm at 45 degrees
                        and his right arm at 135 degrees. Shackles are visible around both wrists
                        and appear to link the figure to the ground below. His torso is twisted
                        slightly forward. His legs are together and shackles are also visible around
                        both ankles. This figure is Orc, the spirit of revolution here restrained.
                        The ground below the figure may be a rock or earth covered in flame-like
                        forms, perhaps grass or other vegetation. Above Orc, a female and a male
                        figure stand facing forward on what may be a rock or higher ground. At left,
                        the nude female figure bends forward and left with legs spread and grasps
                        her head with both hands, as if in mourning or despair. She has long curly
                        hair and a circle, perhaps a halo, is visible around her head. She may be
                        Enitharmon, Orc's mother. At right, the nude male figure stands with legs
                        spread in a contrapposto position. He leans slightly to the left and turns
                        his head to look left and down, perhaps toward the female figure and/or the
                        figure lying below. His arms, with elbows bent, are raised over his head,
                        with his hands raised, palms out, and the fingers of both hands spread
                        apart. His hair is short and his mouth may be open, and he may be speaking
                        or crying out in despair. Like the female figure beside him, a circle that
                        suggests a halo is visible around his head; spiky lines that may indicate
                        beams of light extend outward from his halo. This may be Los, Orc's father.
                        Alternatively, the couple has been identified as Adam and Eve, or as the
                        "Dark virgin" and Urthona (another name for Los). To the right of the male
                        figure's legs, a stone(?) is visible with Blake's signature and date. In the
                        lower left corner of the composition, to the left of the supine figure's
                        head, a structure with a domed roof is visible. A steeple topped with a
                        cross stands in the middle of the dome, which suggests the structure in a
                        church. This structure may suggest St. Paul's Cathedral in London. The
                        majority of the background is indistinguishable, although an area of flames
                        may be visible above the church at left. There may be clouds in the sky to
                        the left of the standing male figure.</illusobjdesc>

                            composition, a nude male figure bends his head back and opens his mouth
                            widely. He may be speaking or crying out, and his expression suggests
                            pain or terror. He may look up toward the standing figures above. He has
                            short hair and an area of flames(?) may encircle his head. Both arms are
                            extended outward from his body with his left arm at 45 degrees and his
                            right arm at 135 degrees. Shackles are visible around both wrists and
                            appear to link the figure to the ground below. His left palm is clearly
                            turned down. His torso is twisted slightly forward. His legs are
                            together and shackles are also visible around both ankles. This figure
                            is Orc, the spirit of revolution here restrained.</illusobjdesc>

                            hands, as if in mourning or despair. She may be crying. She has long
                            curly hair and a circle, perhaps a halo, is visible around her head. Her
                            legs are bent and her right foot is lifted slightly. Her genitals are
                            prominent. She may be Enitharmon, Orc's mother. Alternatively, she has
                            been identified as Eve, or as the "Dark virgin."</illusobjdesc>

                            stands with legs spread in a contrapposto position. He leans slightly to
                            the left and turns his head to look left and down, perhaps toward the
                            female figure and/or the figure lying below. His arms, with elbows bent,
                            are raised over his head, with his hands raised, palms out, and the
                            fingers of both hands spread apart. His hair is short and his mouth may
                            be open, and he may be speaking or crying out in despair. His genitals
                            are prominent. Like the female figure beside him, a circle that suggests
                            a halo is visible around his head; spiky lines that may indicate beams
                            of light extend outward from his halo. This may be Los, Orc's father.
                            Alternatively, he has been identified as Adam, or as Urthona (another
                            name for Los).</illusobjdesc>
