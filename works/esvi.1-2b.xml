                <objnote><p>This impression is in the second state of two.  There is no known impression of the first state, but the two states of the companion plate, *Job*, strongly suggest that this impression of *Ezekiel* is indeed in a revised, second state. Further, the graphic style, particularly the extensive use of burnishing as an element of design, indicates a much later date, c. 1820-25, than the inscribed date of 1794. When Blake revised a plate, he typically did not change the date of the earlier state.  This is also true of the "1793" date retained in the second state of *Job*.</p></objnote>

                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design is based on Ezekiel 24:16-18. Five figures sit or kneel around the supine body of a dead female figure, Ezekiel's wife, who lies on a draped bed or bier at right. The most prominent figure in the composition is the gowned male figure, Ezekiel, at left who kneels facing forward with head and eyes raised. He is old with short hair and a long beard.  He crosses his bent arms in front of his chest with palms resting on opposite arms and fingers spread. A halo of light is visible around his head. In the lower right corner of the composition, a female figure sits facing left in a contracted position bent sharply forward. She has long hair and wears a gown. Her left arm is bent upward to touch her face, which is obscured by her long hair. Her left leg is bent upward and her left foot is visible beneath her gown. Her posture suggests despair or mourning. Behind the two figures in the foreground, Ezekiel's dead wife lies supine on a draped bed or bier with her head at left. She may wear a hat or drapery around her head; her eyes are closed. A halo with spiky beams of light is visible around her head. Behind the supine female figure, the heads of two additional figures, who likely sit or kneel on the opposite side of the bed or bier, are visible. Both figures appear to lower their heads and their postures suggest despair or mourning. The figure at right appears to have short hair and raises both hands to touch or grasp his(?) hair. The figure at left may have short curly hair. He(?) raises his left hand beside his head with palm out, facing forward. The fifth figure is visible against the left margin behind Ezekiel. This figure appears to have short hair and raises one hand to touch his(?) face. His posture also suggests despair or mourning. The background wall of the composition includes a horizontal frieze of square motifs in a design that extends the length of the wall as well as at least three figural pictures. The rightmost image is visible in a frame decorated with intertwined lines and may depict several gowned figures, though the details of the image are unclear. There are two vertical triangular motifs, perhaps vegetation such as grain stems, visible on the wall to the right of this image. The two additional images on the background wall are half-moon roundels. The middle image depicts two gowned pairs of figures flying toward each other over two orbs (one large in the center and one small at right). The left arms of the two figures at right are extended horizontally while the figures at left both raise a single bent arm upward. The leftmost image is only partially visible and may include two figures, one of whom stands at right and one who kneels at left. Both of these figures appear to face left and bend forward to the left.

The rightmost image is visible in a frame decorated with intertwined lines and may depict several gowned figures, though the details of the image are unclear. There are two vertical triangular motifs, possibly vegetation such as graim stems, visible on the wall to the right of this image. The two additional images on the background wall are half-moon (crescent) roundels. The middle image depicts two gowned pairs of figures flying toward each other over two orbs (one large in the center and one small at right). The left arms of the two figures at right are extended horizontally while the figures at left both raise a single bent arm upward. The leftmost image is only partially visible and may include two figures, one of whom stands at right and one who kneels at left. Both of these figures appear to face left and bend forward to the left.</illusobjdesc>
