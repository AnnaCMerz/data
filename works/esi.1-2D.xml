                <objnote><p>Although the figure is a close copy of an unidentified figure in Michelangelo's *Crucifixion of St. Peter* (Pauline Chapel, Vatican), the entire composition is usually credited to Blake as the designer.  The landscape setting is Blake's own invention.  This impression is in the second state of two; the title is taken from the inscription upper right added to this second state.  Blake's pen and ink inscription lower right on the only traced impression of the first state indicates that Blake based the figure on "a drawing by Salviati" (probably Francesco Rossi Salviati).  No such drawing has been traced.  Blake may have taken the figure from an engraving of Michelangelo's entire painting or the figure alone, without surrounding background, in an engraving by Nicholas Beatrizet.  This second state with its added inscriptions was probably executed by Blake c. 1820-25.  He probably printed this impression himself.</p></objnote>

                        A single male figure, identified as Joseph of Arimathea in the inscription top right, faces forward and stands on sandy and rocky ground. He has a long beard and turns his head to look down and to the left. He wears a short tunic or gown as well as a hood-like Phrygian cap with a pointed top that falls to the left. Both arms are bent at the elbow and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, the figure grasps his left arm just above the elbow; his left hand rests on his right forearm and he appears to touch his right upper arm with a partially extended index finger. He bends forward slightly. The figure's right leg is straight while his left is bent at the knee. Several small rocks are visible to the left of his right foot.  His left foot may rest on a rock behind him or he may be stepping or walking forward.  Shadows fall on the ground beneath him and at right. The rocky and sandy shore on which the figure stands extends behind him at right and appears to rise into a cliff. A body of water, no doubt the sea with waves, extends behind the figure and to the left. Sky is visible in the upper left corner where dark clouds appear above beams of sunlight, which may suggest sunrise or sunset.
