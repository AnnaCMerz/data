                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, a gowned female figure sits facing right and holds a nude child with short curly hair who faces left and wraps at least its left arm around her neck.  According to Butlin 83, these figures are the Madonna and Christ child enthroned, but this identification is not certain.  The figures are surrounded by a several circular lines that may suggest a mandorla, perhaps with fire at top.  In the lower left corner, to be seen from the left-hand side of the paper, is a second seated figure, likely female, who faces right but turns her head to look forward.  Her right arm appears bent upward at the elbow and her left extended near her lap.  The back of the chair on which she sits is covered with drapery.  Above this figure at left is a sketch of a figure's head and torso facing forward and slightly left.  Below the central figures at right is a partial sketch of what might be a forward-facing right shoulder covered with drapery.  A drawing of a single leg seen in profile facing right is visible against the right margin, and, to the immediate left, a crossed-out sketch of a foot pointing right.</illusobjdesc>
