               <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
               <updatestmt> The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
                    digital editions of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant
                         Albion</hi> Copy A, from the Morgan Library and Museum, and Copy I, from
                    the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress. <lb/>
                    <lb/>
                    <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake's masterpiece in illuminated printing,
                    comprises 100 relief and white-line etchings, divided into four chapters,
                    executed between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and 1820. It constitutes a
                    recapitulation and summation of his multiple interests, ranging from his own
                    mythology to biblical history, from sexuality to epistemology, and from the
                    Druids to Newton. The cast of characters is vast, but Los (the artist's
                    imagination at work in the material world), Jerusalem and Albion (the female and
                    male portions of divided humanity who must be reunited), the nature goddess
                    Vala, and Jesus play major roles. Each of its four chapters is addressed to a
                    different audience: the Public, the Jews, the Deists, and the Christians. <hi
                         rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> concludes with a vision of human consciousness in a
                    post-apocalyptic universe. Portions of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake’s
                    long manuscript poem, are repeated (often with little revision) in <hi rend="i"
                         >Jerusalem</hi>. <lb/>
                    <lb/> Sixty plates may have been completed by 1807; a few examples were
                    exhibited in 1812. Copy A was produced in 1820 along with copies C and D. In the
                    next year, Blake printed Copies B (chapter 1 only, Plates 1-25) and E, the only
                    copies he colored. He printed Copy F in 1827 but left it uncollated on his
                    deathbed. Copy I is one of three posthumous copies of <hi rend="i"
                         >Jerusalem</hi>, all printed in reddish brown on paper watermarked 1831
                    and/or 1832 by Frederick Tatham, who obtained the copperplates of Blake’s
                    illuminated books after Catherine Blake died in October 1831. <lb/>
                    <lb/> There are two arrangements of the plates in chapter 2, first (Copies A and
                    C) and second (Copies D and E). Copy F was collated by John Linnell, who used
                    his own copy of Jerusalem, Copy C, as the model. Erased numbers on the Copy F
                    impressions, however, indicate that Blake intended to order chapter 2 in the
                    second order, which is its order in the Archive. Copy I and the other posthumous
                    copies also follow the second order. <lb/>
                    <lb/>
                    <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Copies A and I join copies E and F already in the
                    Archive. With Copy A, the Archive now presents <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in
                    both of Blake’s plate orders; with copy I, the Archive presents its first
                    posthumous copy of an illuminated book. Posthumous copies of illuminated books
                    (of <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, <hi rend="i">America</hi>, <hi rend="i"
                    >Europe</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>) are part of Blake’s reception
                    history in the first part of the nineteenth century. They are also important
                    bibliographically because they accurately reveal the copperplate designs and
                    texts, usually more so than lifetime impressions, which were often printed
                    without plate borders and finished in watercolors, with texts touched up and
                    even altered in pen and ink. <lb/>
                    <lb/> In addition to Copies A and I, the Archive is publishing thirty-one
                    proofs, impressions in different states, posthumous impressions, and lifetime
                    impressions of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> not used in copies of the work. These
                    loose impressions form a new category of graphic works, referred to in the index
                    of copies as “MPI,” an abbreviation for Miscellaneous Plates and Impressions. As
                    a group, MPIs reveal Blake’s creative process as it unfolded through production,
                    providing insights and new information about designs and texts. For example, the
                    impression of the <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> frontispiece from the Fitzwilliam
                    Museum (Object 1) is the only impression where the entire text is legible. Blake
                    printed it carefully and clearly and outlined the letters on the impression in
                    pen and black ink; in all published impressions, the text was filled in with
                    printing ink and did not print. <lb/>
                    <lb/>
                    <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>’s MPIs can be accessed like plates in copies of <hi
                         rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and compared with impressions from the same
                    copperplate using the "Objects from the Same Matrix" feature in the second
                    navigation bar below the image. The Archive will gradually publish groups of
                    miscellaneous plates and impressions for each illuminated book (some groups
                    consisting of nearly fifty impressions), which will enable users to trace the
                    evolution of Blake's printed designs. <lb/>
                    <lb/> The Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of
                    109 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected
                    digital images of Blake’s works at their true size, and enlarge and rotate these
                    images to examine texts and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied
                    by diplomatic transcriptions and editors’ notes, as well as illustration
                    descriptions that make it possible to search Blake’s works for visual motifs.
                    The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each
                    digital edition it publishes. <lb/>
                    <lb/> As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
                    restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the
                    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester,
                    the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the
                    international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us
                    permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive. </updatestmt>

                         <p>This impression is in a proof state with many inscriptions printed in
                              white line and outlined in pen and black ink; see the Transcription.
                              These inscriptions, with the exception of illegible fragments, were
                              not printed from the copperplate in the second (published) state found
                              in all other lifetime impressions. Horizontal and vertical white-lines
                              were engraved over some of the proof state inscriptions in the second
                              state. The white-line inscriptions were probably prevented from
                              printing in all other lifetime impressions by filling the incisions
                              with some substance, such as putty, or simply with heavy inking. Some
                              words are legible, printed in white line, in posthumous impressions;
                              see Object 2. An impression of the title page of *Europe* (Bentley
                              Plate 2) is on the verso of this proof. In line 7, three words have
                              been rubbed off the paper of the impression (or deleted "by scratching
                              the copper," Erdman page 809n). Erdman transcribes them conjecturally
                              as "Albion behold pitying" (Erdman page 809n). The first word of the
                              line is not rubbed off the impression, but is also not outlined in pen
                              and ink. It is therefore only faintly visible. Erdman transcribes it
                              as "O" (Erdman 144).</p>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e436">A long-haired male figure, seen from behind but
                              facing right, steps with his right foot across the threshold of an
                              arched entryway whose interior is dark. The disappearance of his right
                              foot across the threshold may imply that he is stepping down onto a
                              stairway, perhaps, that leads to a crypt. With left arm bent upward
                              and fingers slightly spread, he appears to push and peer through the
                              door, only slightly ajar, opening inward on the right. The figure is
                              clothed in a long-sleeved, belted coat or tunic and wide-brimmed hat
                              and appears to be wearing a hard-soled shoe, perhaps a sandal, on his
                              left foot. The figure also appears to be carrying a round object that
                              may be a glowing disk or globe surrounded by radiating beams of light.
                              The globed lantern in the figure’s right hand and the shoe—which in
                              copy E is clearly a sandal—on his visible foot suggests that he is
                              Los, the watchman of the text, who, "Putting on his golden sandals"
                              (Plate 83, Erdman page 242), carries a "red Globe of fire" (Plate 85,
                              Erdman page 244) in his hand as he sings his Watch Song (Plates
                              85-86). Inscriptions on and above the archway identify the structure
                              framing Los as a sepulchral descent into Albion: "Half Friendship is
                              the bitterest Enmity said Los / As he enterd the Door of Death for
                              Albions sake Inspired" (lines 9-10).</illusobjdesc>

                                   of an arched entryway. His visible left foot suggests that he may
                                   be wearing sandals with straps around the calf, although the
                                   bands between his knees and ankles also suggest breeches; he also
                                   wears a long-sleeved, cinched coat or tunic whose bottom folds
                                   and hem swirl to the left and back, and a wide-brimmed hat. With

                                   away from the viewer, he appears to push and peer through a heavy
                                   door, which is slightly ajar. The figure's right arm is at his
                                   side; in his hand he clasps a circular, radiating object, whose
                                   transparency makes it appear as though his fingers simply
                                   intersect with the beams of light. The round object that may be a

                              door, only slightly ajar, opening inward on the right. The figure is
                              clothed in a long-sleeved, belted coat or tunic and wide-brimmed hat
                              and appears to be wearing a hard-soled shoe, perhaps a sandal, on his
                              left foot. The figure also appears to be carrying a round object that
                              may be a glowing disk or globe surrounded by radiating beams of light.
                              The globed lantern in the figure’s right hand and the shoe—which in
                              copy E is clearly a sandal—on his visible foot suggests that he is
                              Los, the watchman of the text, who, "Putting on his golden sandals"
                              (Plate 83, Erdman page 242), carries a "red Globe of fire" (Plate 85,
                              Erdman page 244) in his hand as he sings his Watch Song (Plates
                              85-86). Inscriptions, later expurgated, on and above the archway in a
                              different proof copy identify the structure framing Los as a
                              sepulchral descent into Albion: "Half friendship is the bitterest
                              Enmity said Los / As he enterd the Door of Death for Albions sake
                              Inspired" (Erdman page 144). These expurgated lines are still somewhat
                              visible in this copy.</illusobjdesc>

                                   be wearing sandals with straps around the calf, although the
                                   bands between his knees and ankles also suggest breeches; he also
                                   wears a long-sleeved, cinched coat or tunic whose bottom folds
                                   and hem swirl to the left and back, and a wide-brimmed hat. With

                                   transformed vine of the upper design). Its mouth is open and its
                                   tongue just visible. Stroking the serpent with her left hand just
                                   below the prominent, spiky crest on its head, the woman retrieves
                                   from beneath its head an indeterminate oval-shaped object with
                                   her right, the apparent transaction between the two suggesting a
                                   possible identification of the woman with Eve and, by extension,
                                   the serpent with Satan(?). These associations are tentative: the
                                   serpent, for instance, may have an amiable rather than sinister
                                   aspect. In this vein, it is possible that the woman is giving the
                                   indeterminate oval-shaped object to the serpent; she may be
                                   feeding him, in a parallel to the above vignette which may be
                                   illustrating "the labour of the husbandman" (line 11). Its
                                   undulations terminate in a coil at far right, where the creature
                                   merges with the vine descending from the tree

                              at far right is ambiguous), lamenting over the nude body of the
                              sleeping Albion. He lies supine on a flat, grassy surface with arms
                              raised horizontally, eyes closed, and head—in the foreground—tilted
                              back so that his lifeless expression is clearly visible to the viewer.
                              The mourner left of Albion kneels prostrate beside him, her prominent
                              right hand near his face. The mourner at right covers her face with
                              raised hands and bends forward and left over her legs, which are bent
                              upward; her left foot is visible from beneath the folds of her
                              garment. Three more females grieve at far left: two stand weeping in
                              identical postures, their hands covering their faces. Interposed
                              between them and the prostrate woman, another female, the only mourner
                              whose countenance is visible, tears her hair in vexation, her eyes
                              raised upward. Dark clouds and a sky rent by lightning appear in the
                              background. Two conspicuous stars, their disproportionally large size
                              suggesting, perhaps, that they are falling to the earth, flank

                              sleeping Albion. He lies supine on a flat, grassy surface with arms
                              raised horizontally, eyes closed, and head—in the foreground—tilted
                              back so that his lifeless expression is clearly visible to the viewer.
                              The mourner to Albion's left kneels prostrate beside him, her
                              prominent right hand near his face. The mourner at right buries her(?)
                              head between her knees; her left foot is visible from beneath the
                              folds of her garment. Three more females grieve at far left: two stand
                              weeping in identical postures, their hands covering their faces.
                              Interposed between them and the prostrate woman, another female, the

                              large size suggesting, perhaps, that they are falling to the earth,

                              resting on his right shoulder, and he appears to be dead or sleeping.
                              Flanking him are two pairs of mourners: the pair at far left kneels
                              just beyond Albion's head. Standing at the other end of the body,
                              beside the left foot, are two gowned daughters(?) who weep,
                              grief-stricken, their hands covering their faces (cf. similar scenes

                                   Surrounding his nude body are five of his sons and daughters(?),
                                   one of whom lies atop his left thigh. He is turned clockwise
                                   toward the viewer, lying partially on his right side, and appears
                                   to be dead or sleeping; his head rolls back against his right
                                   shoulder so that his strained neck is fully exposed, and his eyes
                                   appear to be closed (cf. the figure of Albion extended across the
                                   bottom of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 14). Neither arm is
                                   visible, the right presumably obscured by the slightly elevated
                                   terrain, the left drawn back. His legs look to be positioned
                                   together, the flesh and muscle seemingly contoured to resemble
                                   rocky terrain (Albion's Rock?). His left foot may be touching the
                                   gown of one of the mourners at far right.</illusobjdesc>

                              gowned females, their bodies horizontal, hover so as to meet head to
                              head, their raised arms bent up in front of their faces. Over and
                              behind them are numerous wavy lines, perhaps elements of the "web of
                              despair" mentioned in line 5; if so, the females are probably Vala and
                              Jerusalem and their gestures are those of despair. Between lines 12

                              right, a comet with fiery tail. Below that, between lines 14 and 15, a
                              gowned figure, or perhaps two parallel figures, strain against the
                              traces attached to a whirling pinwheel of light, perhaps one of the
                              "Starry Wheels" (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 18, Erdman page
                              163). Two other parallel figures squat to the right of the wheel and
                              push it from behind. Behind these two figures there is an obscure
                              shape, perhaps another flaming comet or star and/or perhaps the faint
                              suggestion of a human form with no distinguishable features except the
                              outline of shoulders and arms. Further to the right, against the night
                              sky, a gowned female(?) with long hair crawls left or hovers with her
                              head down and her arms extended in front of her, embracing what are
                              most likely stars. Several small roundish shapes, which in <hi

                                   upper right leg; she wraps her left arm around the other figure's

                                   left and wraps her left arm around her partner's head. She also
                                   wraps her right arm around the left figure's body, and her hand
                                   is visible resting near the left figure's hip. The two seem to be

                                   arm around the back of the right figure, and rests her hand on
                                   her partner's upper right leg; she wraps her left arm around the
                                   other figure's head; the right figure, who appears to have short

                         <p>This impression is in the second of two proof states. The tip of the
                              lowest flower petal on the right has been blunted and additional white
                              lines have been cut just below (or on the exposed underside of) the
                              lowest flower petal on the left, both as in the third (published)
                              state. The number "12" now appears in white line in the top right
                              corner of the plate. This number may be present on the copperplate in
                              the first proof state but obscured by inking. In addition to the
                              modifications made on the copperplate, there is considerable
                              scratching out on this impression, preparatory for the changes made to
                              the copper evident in the published state. The large worm has been
                              removed. The figure on the right has its right leg, not pictured in
                              the first proof state, extending to the right. Both legs of the figure
                              on the left are now pictured, extending to the left. The two figures
                              now sit side by side with their legs extending in opposite directions,
                              their torsos no longer touching. These modifications to the figures
                              were made on this impression through a combination of scratching out
                              and drawing in brown ink or water color. For the first proof state,
                              see Object 11; for the third (published) state, see Objects 9 and
                              10.</p>

                              probably also the veil/hair of Vala (cf. <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>

                                   face each other in a tight embrace; their lower bodies turn in
                                   opposing directions, left and right, with legs extended. The left
                                   figure faces forward and right, wraps her right arm around the
                                   back of the right figure, and rests her hand on her partner's
                                   upper right leg; she wraps her left arm around the other figure's
                                   head; the right figure, who appears to have short hair, faces
                                   left and wraps her left arm around her partner's head. She also
                                   wraps her right arm around the left figure's body, and her hand
                                   is visible resting near the left figure's hip. The two seem to be
                                   looking into each other's eyes. The two figures are framed by an
                                   elongated dome shape whose outline follows theirs—presumably the
                                   stamen of the lily and probably also the veil/hair of Vala, in
                                   which case she may be the left figure (in effect wearing the

                                   frames the embracing figures. The stamen, which can also be seen
                                   between the two figures, is also probably to be considered

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e21564">In the upper right corner, a nude male with
                              short, curly hair kneels on one knee on a stone or bank with his
                              opposite leg extended forward. He faces left toward two winged figures
                              in flight. The middle figure, a forward-facing gowned female with
                              prominent breasts and long hair streaming above her head, has
                              elaborate wings that suggest a butterfly, bird, or angel. Her arms are
                              raised at 135 degrees, and her legs are apart in a position that
                              approximates running. Her head is raised slightly up toward the left.
                              The legs of the figure on the left are in a similar position, though
                              he(?) faces away from the viewer and twists right. His wings are
                              bat-like, with the additional suggestion of fish fins on his legs. The
                              design likely represents "the Emanation of Los &amp; his / Spectre:

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e16393">The plate is evidently conceived as a single
                              unit, with the cloud-like panel of text and star-studded sky midway
                              down the plate integrating the upper and lower design components. At
                              the top of the plate, a gowned, Christ-like figure with long hair and
                              kneels on grassy terrain. Beams of light radiate from him, creating an
                              aura or halo effect. He looks down at a second male figure, nude, whom
                              he embraces and supports with his bent left leg and extended right
                              arm. The limp posture and insensible demeanor of the nude figure
                              suggest he is unconscious, injured, or dead. The pair probably
                              represent Christ and Albion, respectively, with reference to Albion's
                              despairing words on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 24: "Look not so
                              merciful upon me O thou Slain Lamb of God / I die! I die in thy arms
                              tho Hope is banishd from me" (Erdman page 170; cf. also Plate 48,
                              Erdman page 196). The two are flanked by a palm tree (at left) and a
                              large oak (at right), as described on Plate 23, where Albion collapses
                              "between the Palm tree &amp; the Oak of weeping" (Erdman page 168).
                              Albion's right foot touches a winged sphere that spans the width of
                              the plate. At the bottom of the plate, Jerusalem lies supine on what
                              appears to be a bier floating on the sea. Her shroud-like wings double
                              as a covering for the bier. Hovering above her is the menacing spectre
                              of the text (lines 2, 4), flanked by a sun (at left) and a moon (at
                              right). The sun's fierce rays give way to nighttime clouds and a dark
                              sky.</illusobjdesc>

                                   line (beginning "And One stood forth . . . ") was added by
                                   engraving (i.e., intaglio engraving rather than relief etching)
                                   after the plate was etched (Erdman page 810n); according to
                                   Bentley, the first 6 words were additions "engraved (not etched)
                                   in intaglio," the last four words "incised in White line"
                                   (Bentley page 495n). But the engraving or etching process is
                                   technically the same for white line and for intaglio; the
                                   difference is in the printing, whether from the surface of the
                                   plate or from the etched or engraved grooves. The addition might
                                   be more precisely described as follows: The first five words are
                                   printed in relief, with the surrounding area partly gouged out
                                   with an engraving tool to create a striated or mottled
                                   background—almost a gray tone. Most of the first letter of the
                                   sixth word ("the") continues with this technique, but the last
                                   two letters are defined primarily by thin white lines delineating
                                   the outlines of relief letters surrounded by a relief background.
                                   The last three words and the ampersand were engraved in white
                                   line within islands of relief surfaces that print black. If
                                   indeed all this work on both the letters and their contrasting
                                   backgrounds was executed with a tool rather than with acid, then
                                   the line was added after the initial etching of the
                              plate.</note></l>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e19396">A stormy sky—with threatening clouds and
                              rain—backs the two-figure vignette at the top of the plate, which
                              depicts a long-haired female(?) (right) netting a seemingly
                              defenseless nude male (left). Alternatively, the female may be
                              liberating herself from the web-like structure still binding the male.
                              The net is distinct from yet continuous with the roots or tree
                              branches that emerge from the earth to entangle the male. His overall
                              position is severely twisted, upper body facing down with head buried
                              in arms, lower body supine with legs raised. The bank or shore on
                              which he vegetates gives way at right to a dark body of water over
                              which the female hovers with arms raised horizontally. Her long hair
                              merges almost imperceptibly with the net fragments clinging to her
                              hands, fingers, and feet. The plethora of both textual and pictorial
                              images of Reuben and Albion enrooted in or trapped by visceral and/or
                              vegetative fibres makes it likely that the male at left represents one
                              of these characters, while either Vala or a Daughter of Albion,
                              females who are particularly dexterous with net-like trappings in <hi

                                   suggesting pain, resignation, and/or despair. The plethora of

                                   The birds after lines 20-22, 47-49 (perhaps an eagle), and 61-64

                                   tails; they may be ascending in flight. The bird—or butterfly or

                                   are prominent after lines 32-37. The two larger ones may be
                                   dragonflies, the two smaller ones flies, bees, or moths. There
                                   are three other flying insects, the middle one of which (beneath

                                   as discrete fragments of vegetation. In the first stanza, there
                                   is a leaf-like extension on the "C" of "Cloud" at the end of line
                                   4 and a bit of vegetation under "Death" at the end of line 12.
                                   Between stanzas 2 and 3, there are elaborate extensions on
                                   "Beulah" (a branch), "Daughter" (a tree), and "Beulah" in line
                                   21; compare the rudimentary extensions that mark almost the same
                                   sequence of words—in this case a plural "Daughters"—in line 39
                                   below. Between stanzas 3 and 4, there is a mixture of looped
                                   vines, letter extensions, and the like. Similarly after line 30,
                                   there are extensions from lines above and below, including a leaf
                                   from the "s" of "afflictions" in line 31. "[T]ears" in line 31 is
                                   curiously connected by a squiggle to "West" two lines below.
                                   "[G]old," "Eight," and "Every" in lines 35-37 have odd
                                   extensions. The one-line stanza at line 53 is set off by numerous
                                   decorative extensions on letters in lines 53 and 54 and by an
                                   especially elaborate extension from the final letter of "tears"
                                   at the end of line 53 that fills the margin in that area and
                                   sends a vine-like branch back between lines 53 and 54. After line
                                   56 this involved tangle of vegetation may include fruit, perhaps
                                   even a tiny mushroom.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e24227">The design is closely related to the text of
                                   <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 70, lines 1-15 (Erdman page
                              224), which describes the "form of mighty Hand sitting on Albions
                              cliffs" (line 1). His shoulders "Bear Three strong sinewy Necks &amp;
                              Three awful &amp; terrible Heads . . . brooding incessantly" (lines
                              4-5). He is said there to represent "the aggregate of the Twelve Sons
                              of Albion" (line 10), which "divide to Twelve: the key-bones &amp; the
                              chest dividing in pain" (line 12), "And there they combine into Three
                              Forms, named Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke" (line 15). Thus a
                              three-headed nude male with a melancholy ("brooding") expression sits
                              at the edge of a wave-swept island with a grassy top surface and steep
                              sides. Facing forward with his legs half-immersed in the water, Hand
                              sits on a flat surface at the foot of the cliffs. Crowns adorn his two
                              rightmost heads. From an opening in his upper chest emerges a
                              serpentine stream of other nude males, presumably Bacon, Newton, and
                              Locke, who hover against a background of flames that continue into the
                              right margin of the text above. The figure nearest Hand has two heads;
                              from an opening in his chest emerges a second figure from whom—though
                              in his rear-facing position his chest cannot be seen—a third figure
                              emerges. In the skies above the horizon on either side of the island
                              are contrasting scenes: on the left, streaks of rain, a bolt of
                              lightning and a sphere that may be a full moon; on the right, a
                              sunrise or sunset showing the sun partially visible at the horizon and
                              two other spheres above it, perhaps another sun and a moon with its

                                   incessantly" (lines 4-5). He is said there to represent "the
                                   aggregate of the Twelve Sons of Albion" (line 10), which "divide
                                   to Twelve: the key-bones &amp; the chest dividing in pain" (line
                                   12), "And there they combine into Three Forms, named Bacon &amp;
                                   Newton &amp; Locke" (line 15). Thus a three-headed nude male with
                                   short hair, beard, and a melancholy ("brooding") expression sits
                                   at the edge of a cliff. Crowns adorn his two rightmost heads.
                                   Hand sits on a flat surface at the foot of the cliffs. His lower
                                   body is rotated clockwise to face left, while his upper body
                                   faces forward. His legs are in the water (hence visible only
                                   above the knees). His left head rests on his left hand and his
                                   right head on his right in a position conventionally associated
                                   with melancholy. From an opening in his upper chest emerges a

                                   Newton, and Locke, perhaps in that order. The short-haired,
                                   two-headed one nearest Hand may be Bacon, who sometimes
                                   associated himself with two-headed Janus; from an opening in his
                                   chest emerges a second figure. The body of the Bacon figure faces
                                   the viewer while his heads face left and right (or down and up,
                                   respectively). The lower part of his right leg disappears into
                                   Hand's chest (at least one leg of every figure is not visible
                                   from the knees down). His left leg is drawn up and his foot
                                   planted on Hand's face, as if to push from that point. A bit of
                                   his right arm is visible just above Hand's crown; his bent left
                                   arm is raised up over his left head and disappears behind the top
                                   of his right head. It is possible that this figure's two heads
                                   may in fact be the heads of two separate bodies, the rear one
                                   invisible below the neck.</illusobjdesc>

                         <illusobjdesc id="d0e24227">The design is closely related to the text of
                                   <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 70 (Erdman page 224), lines
                              1-15, which describes the "form of mighty Hand sitting on Albions
                              cliffs" (line 1). His shoulders "Bear Three strong sinewy Necks &amp;
                              Three awful &amp; terrible Heads . . . brooding incessantly" (lines
                              4-5). He is said there to represent "the aggregate of the Twelve Sons
                              of Albion" (line 10), which "divide to Twelve: the key-bones &amp; the
                              chest dividing in pain" (line 12), "And there they combine into Three
                              Forms, named Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke" (line 15). Thus a
                              three-headed nude male with a melancholy ("brooding") expression sits
                              at the edge of a wave-swept island with a grassy top surface and steep
                              sides. Facing forward with his legs half-immersed in the water, Hand
                              sits on a flat surface at the foot of the cliffs. Crowns adorn his two
                              rightmost heads. From an opening in his upper chest emerges a
                              serpentine stream of other nude males, presumably Bacon, Newton, and
                              Locke, who hover against a background of flames that continue into the
                              right margin of the text above. The figure nearest Hand has two heads;
                              from an opening in his chest emerges a second figure from whom—though
                              in his rear-facing position his chest cannot be seen—a third figure
                              emerges. In the skies above the horizon on either side of the island
                              are contrasting scenes: on the left, streaks of rain, a bolt of
                              lightning and a sphere that may be a full moon; on the right, a
                              sunrise or sunset showing the sun partially visible at the horizon and
                              two other spheres above it, perhaps another sun and a moon with its
                              crescent visible at the top. Beams of light show against a dark sky
                              that continues up the right margin and across the top of the
                              plate.</illusobjdesc>

                                   Newton &amp; Locke" (line 15). Thus a three-headed nude male with
                                   short hair, beard, and a melancholy ("brooding") expression sits
                                   at the edge of a cliff. Hand sits on a flat surface at the foot
                                   of the cliffs. Crowns adorn his two rightmost heads. His lower
                                   body is rotated clockwise to face left, while his upper body
                                   faces forward. His legs are in the water (hence visible only
                                   above the knees). His left head rests on his left hand and his
                                   right head on his right in a position conventionally associated
                                   with melancholy. From an opening in his upper chest emerges a

                                   respectively). The lower part of his right leg disappears into
                                   Hand's chest (at least one leg of every figure is not visible
                                   from the knees down). His left leg is drawn up and his foot

                                   of his right head. It is possible that this figure's two heads
                                   may in fact be the heads of two separate bodies, the rear one

                              printed only in this impression. They were either scraped and

                              burnished off the copperplate, then this impression is in a first

                              obscured by heavy inking that clogged its white lines or, in copy E,
                              obscured by subsequent hand coloring.</p>

                                   side; the tips of her fingers touch (or nearly touch) the ground.
                                   She does not appear to be holding the scepter, though her arm and
                                   hand presumably keep it in place. She wears a spiky crown. Vala's
                                   hunched-over posture, like that of her companions, suggests
                                   despair or resignation.</illusobjdesc>

                              inclusion in copy E of *Jerusalem*. Instead, Blake sold or gave this
                              impression to his patron John Linnell. Copy E includes a substitute
                              impression printed in black ink. For a detailed explanation, see
                              Robert N. Essick, "William Blake's *Jerusalem*, Plate 51," *Art
                              Bulletin of Victoria*, no. 31 (1990): 20-25. Blake's monogram ("WB",
                              lower left) does not appear in copies C, D, and E of *Jerusalem*.
                              These impressions may have been printed before the addition of the
                              monogram, but more probably the monogram was present on the plate and
                              was obscured by heavy inking that clogged its white lines or, in copy
                              E, obscured by subsequent hand coloring.</p>

                              sits on top of a giant sunflower dais. Her wings, divided into three
                              sets, do double duty as a throne, each of the sets resembling the
                              lateral extensions of a wing chair. The middle and anterior wings, the
                              latter of which seem to serve simultaneously as a bustle to the gown,
                              are relatively nondescript, in contrast to the large-scale hind wings
                              elaborately inlaid with celestial motifs, including stars, a crescent
                              moon (left) and a globe or planet (right). The figure's upswept hair
                              is built to great heights, with a triple-tiered crown worked into it,
                              each tier ornamented with a fleur-de-lis. Her elbows are propped on
                              her knees, chin resting in the palms of her upraised hands, and she
                              appears to be sleeping, as her eyes are closed. The figure may be
                              associated with Vala or Rahab, but iconically she strongly resembles
                              Jerusalem as depicted on the title page and as described in Los's
                              Watch Song on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 86 (Erdman page 244):
                              "Wingd with Six Wings" (line 1) that spread like a "canopy" (line 9).
                              The identification is made more plausible by reading the chapter
                              title, "Jerusalem" (inscribed on the body of water at lower left) as a
                              caption to the design. Beams of light radiate from her
                              wings-cum-throne into the surrounding darkness, which may suggest
                              night.</illusobjdesc>

                                   of the sets resembling the lateral extensions of a wing chair;
                                   their general configuration suggests a heart. The figure's

                                   extending to the top border of the design; a triple-tiered crown
                                   is worked into her hair, each tier ornamented with a

                                   sleeping as her eyes are closed. The figure's attributes
                                   inevitably suggest an angel or a fairy, but also a butterfly,

                                   strongly resembles Jerusalem as depicted on the title page and as
                                   described in Los's Watch Song on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>

                                   spread like a "canopy" (line 9). The identification is made more
                                   plausible by reading the chapter title, "Jerusalem" (inscribed on
                                   the body of water at lower left) as a caption to the design.

                              crowns—the figure at right clearly female, the other probably
                              male—seem to be (willingly) held in the coils of a seven-headed dragon
                              or serpent; alternatively their scaly lower bodies, only a small
                              portion of which the viewer sees, suggest that they are the human
                              heads and torsos of the beast. The female faces forward, her cheek
                              nuzzling one of the serpent's heads, which she fondles with her left
                              hand. Her right arm is bent upward, over a giant coil. She is probably
                              Rahab, presiding over the "Twenty-seven Heavens" (line 10), the final
                              group of which is represented in lines 15-20 in terms reminiscent of

                              left, and he likewise appears to be embracing a serpent's head with
                              his right arm, of which only the upper part is visible; below his arm
                              is the backside of a third figure whose head, if human, is presumably
                              buried within the coils. All the serpents save one have open mouths,
                              the long, forked tongues of the outermost heads darting out, and
                              five(?) have prominent horns, as well. The monster's coils are marked
                              with intersecting circles that form loops and spirals, a motif that
