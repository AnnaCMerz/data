                    <illusobjdesc>Seen in profile, a female figure with a horse's head walks right
                        in this drawing. With mouth open and long, flame-like hair or mane standing
                        on end, she holds her bent right arm near the center of her chest and
                        extends the left near her side. The fingers of both hands are spread.
                        Although both legs are only visible above the knee, the figure appears to
                        step forward with her right leg. She is likely nude, though some traces of a
                        translucent gown may be visible near her buttocks and upper thighs. Butlin
                        88 suggests that this figure may be Hippa, an Egyptian goddess believed by
                        Ovid and other classical authors to have been turned into a horse. A few
                        rounded pencil lines right of the main figure might be a crouching figure
                        with curly hair, facing left.</illusobjdesc>
