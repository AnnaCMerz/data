A very slight pencil sketch on the verso includes two seated figures in right profile, their legs bent and extended to the right.  The figure behind and to the right is an elderly(?) bearded man looking up.  There may be the outline of a building upper left.</p></objnote>

                    <illusobjdesc>The design features a single female figure who sits or crouches on the floor and holds a staff or rod in her right hand. The young woman wears a long-sleeved gown with a gathered, cowl-like collar; a veil covers part of her long, curly hair, two tendrils of which escape onto her shoulders. She faces forward, sitting on the floor with her legs bent and drawn up toward her chest. Her legs are pulled together, showing her knees prominently. Both feet are planted on the ground, and all ten toes appear below the hem of her gown. The woman holds both arms down at her sides. The fingers of her right hand point downward, and her palm faces away from the viewer. She holds a small staff between her thumb and forefinger; it extends upward and slightly to the left, near her right shoulder. The woman may use her left arm to brace herself against the ground. Her fingers are spread, perhaps to grasp a rock or some other object on which she sits. Behind her, a ledge of some sort appears between the floor and the wall or other background.</illusobjdesc>
