<note>The place of publication is not printed in the work, but Blake
lived in London during the composition and etching of *Songs of Innocence*.  When this copy was printed, Blake was probably living in Felpham, Sussex, but it is possible that it was not printed and/or colored until he returned to London in autumn 1803.</note>

long dress sits erect in a chair.  In her lap she holds an open book that two children read,

the right, with long hair, is probably a girl.  To the right of the group is a
large apple(?) tree bearing fruit; around the trunk loosely spirals a vine.
Various small figures can be seen among the letters of the title, including a piper wearing a
broad-brimmed hat standing in the crook of the first letter of "Innocence" (line 4).  Birds
fly in the sky beneath and to the left of the "S" and above the "N" in "SONGS" (line 2).  Another bird
flies upward above the first "n" of "Innocence." The background landscape may include low hills in the distance.  A slight rosy tint just above the hills hints at a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

There is a ram just to the left of the shepherd's lower right leg.  Up the right margin beside the shepherd is a leafy tree encircled by a vine with lily-like blossoms (not colored in this copy) near the bottom. The tree's longest branch extends almost to the left margin.  There are more trees and a hilltop in the background, where the light suggests that the time is sunrise or sunset.  On the left a single bird with broad wings and long tail feathers ascends in the light.  Three smaller birds soar to the right of the large bird.  There may be two even smaller birds perched on the limb below and to the right of those in flight.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The elements of the design combine and develop a selection of those on the previous plate.  Christ, in conventional representation as a shepherd with beard, gown, and crook, sits facing left on a bank.  There is a halo around his head. Two nude boys&#8212;the boy on the left dark of skin and his companion pale of skin&#8212;stand in front of him.  One, probably the "little English boy" (line 7) whom the little black boy addresses in the final two stanzas of the poem, stands at Jesus's knee, holds his hands in a praying gesture, and looks up at Jesus, who looks down at him.  The other boy, probably the little black boy from the previous plate, stands behind the little English boy with his right hand out toward him to "stroke his silver hair" (line 12).  All three are sheltered under a leafy, willow-like tree that forms a tight arch over their heads.  Its roots may be partially exposed on the bank to the right.  A flock of sheep grazes to the left of the left-most boy.  A river runs at the foot of the plate.  A vine or plant grows lower left.  A vine rooted in the bank to the right of the tree grows up the right margin.  The tree is backed by leafy plants or trees. Blue and gray washes in the text area, combined with a hint of pink to the right of the tree, suggest a sky and clouds, possibly a somewhat dark sky just before sunrise or just after sunset. </illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A lithe and leafy tree, rooted bottom right, grows up the right edge of the plate.  A vine grows up around its trunk.  Clusters of grapes or flowers hang from the vine opposite stanzas 6 and 7. At the midway point the vine seems to produce the loopy tendril that terminates near the bird with long tail feathers that ascends to the right of stanza 6.  Other birds fly to the right of lines 4, 7, and 13.  There may also be a bird perching on the branch to the right of line 6. The letters of the title are ornamented with elaborate extensions and flourishes.  The three capital letters, along with the "h" of "Anothers," which is decorated with a kind of forked top above and a long flag below, and the coil following the final "w," are the most notable (line 2).  The left margin is dominated by a lattice of branches from two thin trees rooted at bottom left.  Leafless below, the branches in the upper reaches of the margin carry the suggestion of leaves, and there are very loopy tendrils beside the first three stanzas that may be a separate vine or part of the tree.  A figure playing a pipe stands next to the right tree, lower left.  A second figure climbs in the branches above, opposite stanza 7.  There may also be a third figure with arms raised, opposite stanzas 2 and 3, although the figure merges with the tendrils in this copy.  A fourth human form, left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one arm raised.  Blue, yellow, and rose washes suggest the sky at sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

A second figure climbs in the branches above, opposite stanza 7.  Perhaps a third, opposite stanzas 2 and 3, raises his arms as if in supplication—although the figure is hard to separate from the vines in this copy.  The final figure, clearly represented left of stanza 1, stands facing right with at least one arm raised vertically.</illusobjdesc>

                        vegetation.  Five figures sit behind the table, away from the viewer; the female at far right
                        extends her arm to hold a drinking glass that rests on the table.  Near the ends of the table on the
                        front side, two other figures sit in chairs that are turned sideways, facing one another.  Each
                        figure holds a glass on the table.  Between them stands an eighth figure, a male in tights.  In upraised hands he holds a glass (right) and a plumed hat (left).  The
                        faces of all but one of the figures on the far side of the table are visible.  The three figures on the
                        near side face away from the viewer toward the rest of the company.  The text mentions "green
                        woods," "meadows," and a "table" in "the shade" (lines 3, 7, 11-12).  The 
                        suggestion of a shady refuge is reinforced by the shadows on the ground, lower

                    <illusobjdesc>The illustration seems to depict chimney sweeper Tom Dacre's dream of liberation for himself and his fellow sweeps by an angel, who releases them from their "coffins of black" to run "naked" down a "green plain" and "wash in a river" (lines 14-18). (The river is not visible in this copy.) Against a background of grass(?) are twelve(?) small figures, including one adult and eleven(?) smaller children.  At bottom right a gowned adult bends forward, reaching toward a nude figure emerging from the earth or one of the coffins of the text.  Across the rest of the bottom of the plate are nude figures standing or running with their arms raised in various positions.  Two pairs are embracing.  Behind the gowned adult a tree grows up the right margin and becomes visually linked to the interlinear decorations.  The tinting of the lower part of the text area suggests a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

The boy reaches out to touch(?) the nose of one of them—perhaps the "Little Lamb" of the text—with his hands.  Behind the flock are a leafy oak tree with a large trunk (left) and a cottage or barn (right) with an open doorway.  On its thatched roof perch two birds, often identified as doves.  Two slender trees, one on each side, frame the plate.  Both trees are intertwined with vines that sprout leaves and several loopy tendrils.  Where the tree branches meet and intertwine at the top, creating an arch between the title and the text of the poem, they are leafy.  Vines or branches grow across the plate near its midpoint to help fill the space between the two stanzas.  Blue and gray washes suggest sky; yellow and pink washes hint at a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

Some hold one another around the waist or shoulder (clearest in the eighth pair from the left).  Most of the boys wear hats. They are led by a pair of gowned adults, both with hats and carrying staffs or scepters.  At the bottom of the plate a similar procession occurs, though with seven pairs of girls instead of nine of boys, walking left instead of right, and led by a single gowned female(?) figure who is holding something, probably a book.  The girls wear dresses, possibly with aprons. The figures altogether represent the charity children of the text, "walking two &amp; two" behind the "Grey headed beadles" who "walkd before with wands" into St. Paul's cathedral "on a Holy Thursday" (lines 3-7).  Blue wash behind the figures at top suggests sky, and yellow wash behind the figures at bottom may suggest sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>The text is crowded with a mixture of interlinear vegetation, animals, birds, and human figures.  The block letters of the title (line 2) are surrounded by vine-like loops and flame-like leaves (attached to the "H" and "L" of "HOLY" and the "S," "D," and "Y" of "THURSDAY") and combinations of those with other long-leaved plants (especially under the title).  Many of the letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like extensions.  After the area around the title, the most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between stanzas, where rows of leaves and vines (most of them originating in extensions of letters of the text in lines adjacent to the spaces) alternate with an occasional bird (below "into the" in line 7) or human figure (beneath "innocent" in line 11).  Beneath the final stanza is another particularly busy area of decoration, dominated by vines and leaves but including a bird perching on a vine, wings outspread, facing the viewer. Some of the decorations are suggestive of birds (e.g., above "Seated" in line 9 and above "their" in line 11) or human figures (e.g., in the crook of the "L" of "HOLY" [line 2]) but are more likely to be bits of vine or leaf.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The text is crowded with a mixture of interlinear vegetation, animals, birds, and human figures.  The block letters of the title (line 2) are surrounded by vine-like loops and flame-like leaves (attached to the "H" and "L" of "HOLY" and the "S," "D," and "Y" of "THURSDAY") and combinations of those with other long-leaved plants (especially under the title).  Many of the letters of the long-lined poem have decorative vine-like extensions.  After the area around the title, the most extravagant decoration is reserved for the spaces between stanzas, where rows of leaves and vines (most of them originating in extensions of letters of the text in lines adjacent to the spaces) alternate with an occasional bird or human figure.  Beneath the final stanza is another particularly busy area of decoration, dominated by vines and leaves.  Some of the decorations are suggestive of birds (e.g., above "Seated" in line 9 and above "their" in line 11) or human figures (e.g., in the crook of the "L" of "HOLY" [line 2]) but are equally likely to be bits of vine or leaf.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A serpentine plant-like structure with flame-like leaves, apparently rooted at right in the strip of grassy ground that runs across the bottom of the plate, grows along the ground under the last stanza and then up the left margin.  Between stanzas three and four the plant forks.  One part continues up the left margin and ends under the title.  Another part of the plant curves between the third and fourth stanzas and crosses into the right margin, curves back over the title and ends in an upward flourish at top left.  The large plant is encircled in its upper reaches by a leafy vine that is rooted, like the plant itself, at the bottom right corner.  From there the vine climbs up the right margin behind the standing figure and then, after arching over the figure's head, onto the flame-like plant, which the vine continues to climb until it terminates just left of the title.  A second vine, much shorter, appears in front of the plant at the bottom of the plate, left of the reclining figure.  There are several human figures on and around the plants: (at top left) a gowned female with long hair walks right; a second gowned female, probably with long hair, floats behind her, pointing right; two figures kneel side by side, facing right, hands raised in prayer; (at bottom right) a gowned figure stands, with an arm extended, perhaps touching the left hand of a nude male figure to the left, who reclines with his right arm braced for support, his left raised vertically; below and in front of this pair, a third figure, perhaps a half-nude female, reclines, supported on her left arm.  The green coloring of the ground suggests grass; gray, rose, and blue tinting in and around text areas may indicate a dark sky near sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A slender tree with leafy branches grows up the right margin, bends under and around the left end of the title—whose lettering harmonizes with the surrounding foliage—and curves back over it.  A second branch of the tree continues up the right side of the plate to complete the circle around the title (line 2).  Several leafy branches extend left into the spaces left by short lines of the poem.  The tree is loosely encircled by a leafy vine whose termination, perhaps a little beyond the point where the tree bends left, is unclear.  In some copies there is a second, smaller tree to the right of the tree and vine, but in this copy the remains of the second tree’s trunk look like a spray of leaves hanging down from the vine, and the second tree’s branches seem to grow from the vine or from the first tree. Just left of the trees, lower right, a lion lies in a cave with vegetation arching over it.  There are winged angelic figures in the tree, one standing with wing outspread and one arm extended at top right, a second sitting with wings folded on a branch beneath the first, and a third hovering or standing on one foot just above the lion's den.  Two birds perch on a branch right of line 6.  In the left margin are other figures and objects (bottom to top): one gowned, standing on the shadowed ground and facing the third stanza; just above that, a figure with one arm raised; another, arms raised vertically (in some copies it appears to be standing on a sphere, but in this copy, the figure's gown forms a curl instead); just above that another, smaller, with wings and arms outspread.  All the figures may be the angels described in the text (Object 18, line 14; Object 19, line 7).  Above the top figure on the left, left of line 6, is a sphere (the sun or moon?); scattered across this same space in the left margin are nine dots, perhaps stars.  Two small circles left of lines 15 and 16 may be additional stars or planets. The background coloring suggests dusk.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Several varieties of vegetation fill spaces around the text and between stanzas. The initial "A" in the title (line 2) sprouts a plant-like structure on the left, while a loopy vine-like extension dangles all the way down the left margin.  The vegetation in the upper right margin—beside the "m" of "Dream" in the title—seems to be an arc of tasseled grass or grain that curves back over the title.  Beneath it—opposite stanzas 1 and 2—are three or four clusters of flame-like leaves or tufts of grass.  Below those are a bit of leafy vine (after line 11) and a branch or root of some sort (after line 14).  In the lower right margin—opposite stanzas 4 and 5—is an odd tree(?).  In front of the tree stands a figure, robed, wearing a hat, and holding a staff—probably the "watchman of the night" (line 18), the glow-worm of the text in human form.  He is one of four small human figures on the plate.  The other three are in the area of the title: lying, presumably sleeping, on the left stroke of the initial "A"; sitting, perhaps reading, in the "D" of "Dream"; and floating or flying, with arms raised horizontally, between bits of vegetation beneath the "e" of "Dream."  The animal life of the poem appears in similarly tiny forms in the margins: there could be an ant (the "Emmet" of line 5) to the right of line 5 and another (very indistinct) crawling beneath the "her" in line 10; a (similarly indistinct) worm or caterpillar nestled in the lower right sprigs of the vegetation right of line 7; and winged beetles(?) (lines 20-21) flying right of lines 6 and 19 (the former is clearer in other copies).  A bird, perhaps an eagle, unmentioned in the text, spreads its wings above "dream" in line 3.</illusobjdesc>

                            figures surrounds the text, especially left, right, and top, and fills spaces between all the stanzas.  
                            The dominant form is perhaps the vegetation with flame-like leaves that swirls in the spaces of
                            the 
                            right margin (with a more conventional leaf or two at bottom right), underneath the title, and
                            down the left margin.  Tendrils extending from both margins help separate the stanzas from one
                            another.  The vine right of the final stanza on the plate has several loops suggesting a spiral.  The
                            vine full of leaves and flowers(?) that extends across the top of the plate above the title and fills
                            the top right corner and the space right of the first stanza is distinct from the flame-like 
                            vegetation that dominates the rest of the plate.  Extensions of letters in the title (line 2) contribute to both 
                            forms of vegetation: the initial "A" and "C" to the vine above, the "S" to both.  In the text of the 
                            poem, occasional letters have modest decorative extensions, and there are a few bits of stray 
                            decorative vegetation.</illusobjdesc>

A matron-figure in cap and gown, evidently the nurse of the title (line 2), sits on the ground against the trunk and reads a book in her lap.

stretch something, perhaps a piece of cloth used in a game, between them; a girl raises her arms
horizontally and faces right with legs outspread; a boy raises his arms 
higher, as does the long-haired girl to the right of him, whose leg is extended behind her; holding 
her hand, a boy runs left and reaches forward to hold the hand of another running or striding boy, 
left leg extended behind him, who raises his free left hand as he moves left and back, perhaps 
toward the opening between the pair furthest left.  All the girls wear gowns; all the boys wear 
tight-fitting garments.  These are the "little ones" who "leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'd" (line 17)
and 
remonstrate with the nurse in the poem.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>In a dark landscape dominated by the trunks of three large trees, a long-haired adult figure, visually ambiguous in gender but male according to the text, dressed in a high-waisted long gown holds the arm of a gowned child.  The two figures look at one another as they walk forward, on rather barren (but perhaps grassy) ground, toward the viewer.  The child raises his right arm to hold the adult's arm.  The adult figure has a golden area around his head that suggests a halo.  A dark area around the child's head, as on the previous plate, suggests a hat or halo.  The text describes the "little boy lost" who is "by the hand led" to safety by "God . . . like his father in white" (lines 3-7).

in gender though the reference to "God . . . like his father" (lines 5-6) suggests that he is male&#8212;walks
beside
a boy whose arm he holds (he holds his opposite arm by his side).  If this is God, it is very
probably Christ, given the similarities between this figure and several of Blake's other
representations of Christ.  Both feet are exposed; his left 
foot is forward.  He looks down toward the boy.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The two figures walk forward toward the viewer.  A gowned male child with short, curly hair walks forward toward the viewer beside a similarly dressed adult whose arm he holds and up at whom he looks.  The child raises his left arm at 45 degrees, his right at 135 degrees.  He is stepping forward with his right leg.   A dark area around the child's head, similar to what we see on the previous plate, suggests a hat or halo.  Judging from the previous plate, the boy may be wearing shoes.  The text describes the "little boy lost" who is "by the hand led" to safety by "God . . . like his father in white" (lines 3-7).</illusobjdesc>
