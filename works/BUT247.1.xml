                    <illusobjdesc>Ten figures hover or fly above a recumbent female figure in this
                        image, which illustrates The Vision of Queen Katharine in Act 4, Scene 2 of
                        Shakespeare's play <hi rend="i">Henry VIII</hi>. In the lower third of the
                        scene, a female figure lies supine with her head at right on a heavily
                        draped couch or bed. She has long hair and wears a gown. She may rest her
                        head on a pillow(?) and her eyes are closed, suggesting sleep. Dark round
                        forms, probably clouds, are visible near her feet lower left. This figure,
                        Queen Katharine, is the wife of King Henry VIII who wishes to divorce her
                        (as she has not born a male heir) and marry Anne Boleyn. Katharine becomes
                        ill, and it is during her sickness in which The Vision occurs. The Vision
                        itself constitutes the upper part of the image and includes ten figures
                        (although only six figures appear in The Vision in the play). Near the left
                        margin, a pair of female figures face each other and appear to hover. Facing
                        forward, the gowned figure has long hair and bends both arms upward to hold
                        an object (perhaps a wicker basket or bowl?) on her head. Immediately in
                        front of her, a nude figure with long hair that may be braided faces away.
                        This figure bends both arms at right angles and in her right hand holds one
                        of the garlands mentioned in the play's text. A second pair of figures
                        occupy the upper center of the design. The higher figure appears to be nude
                        and female with long, flame-like hair that extends outward in spiky
                        tendrils. She faces forward but looks down and only the upper half of her
                        body is visible, as if she is emerging from the colorful cloud behind her.
                        Both arms are extended horizontally, palms facing down. Below her left arm,
                        a second figure, who appears to be a nude male figure with short hair,
                        mimics her posture with his left arm extended horizontally. His body,
                        however, may be twisted: though he faces forward and down, his left leg is
                        extended to the left and his right arm is by his side (perhaps touching the
                        female figure above him). A third pair of figures hover or float against the
                        right margin. The gender of neither figure is distinct. The closer figure
                        has short hair and likely wears a transparent gown. She(?) faces forward and
                        slightly left with his legs crossed at the ankle. With bent arms, she plays
                        a lyre; her open mouth suggests she may also sing. The second figure has
                        short hair and wears a gown. Facing forward, this figure bends its left arm
                        to hold a bowl or (wicker?) basket on its head, echoing the pose and
                        accoutrement of the long-haired figure at far left. Four additional figures
                        are visible in the center of the image. The two uppermost of these who are
                        both nude hold a circular garland or wreath between them with one extended
                        arm each. The body of the figure at right is horizontal with head at right
                        though its head is turned to look left, perhaps back toward its companion,
                        who faces forward but extends its legs left. Below this pair, a single male
                        figure with short hair and a blue shirt rides a horse facing forward and
                        slightly right. He bends his right arm to hold the horse's neck and leans
                        forward. Both horse and rider may look toward the final figure in The Vision
                        scene who hovers horizontally facing forward and right. This male figure,
                        who is nude but for a single swath of drapery covering his genitals, has
                        short hair and wears a quiver on his back with a bow and the end of at least
                        one arrow visible. He extends both arms horizontally, palms facing up, and
                        may hold or touch an object (perhaps another garland or branch?) visible
                        near his left hand and just above the sleeping figure's head. Blue sky is

                            Scene 2 of Shakespeare's play <hi rend="i">Henry VIII</hi>. In the lower
                            third of the scene, a female figure lies supine with her head at right
                            on a heavily draped couch or bed. She has long hair and wears a gown.
                            She may rest her head on a pillow(?) and her eyes are closed, suggesting
                            sleep. Dark round forms (perhaps clouds or stones?) are visible near her
                            feet lower left. This figure, Queen Katharine, is the wife of King Henry
                            VIII who wishes to divorce her (as she has not born a male heir) and
                            marry Anne Boleyn. Katharine becomes ill, and it is during her sickness
                            in which The Vision occurs.</illusobjdesc>
