            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
                electronic editions of Blake's illustrations to Robert John Thornton's edition of
                    <hi rend="i">The Pastorals of Virgil</hi> (1821) and a selection of his
                preliminary drawings for his Virgil wood engravings. The texts and images in both
                groups are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and ImageSizer
                applications. <lb/><lb/> When planning a third edition of his successful school text
                of Virgil's <hi rend="i">Pastorals</hi>, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to
                contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work. His assignment was to
                illustrate Ambrose Philips' English "imitation" of Virgil's first eclogue. Blake
                produced four small designs as relief etchings on a single copperplate, but these
                were rejected by Thornton. There may have been several reasons, including the
                unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the
                difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual
                matrix. Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he
                had never before worked, instead of relief etchings. He executed a series of at
                least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash preliminary drawings; these were probably
                approved by Thornton. The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however,
                were far less conventional. Thornton was again taken aback by Blake's bold
                transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities. Several influential artists,
                including John Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake's work; their
                opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition. Three designs were
                engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake's own productions in
                wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake's first design implying his
                hesitations about Blake's artistry. Pre-publication proofs of Blake's wood
                engravings show that each group of four were cut on a single block; these were cut
                apart, slightly reduced in size on all four sides, and printed with brief
                letterpress captions. This format, as published in Thornton's Virgil, is preserved
                in our reproductions. <lb/><lb/> In addition to his original wood engravings, Blake
                contributed six copperplate intaglio engravings picturing famous classical figures.
                He also executed a reduced drawing, perhaps directly on the woodblock, based on a
                painting by Nicolas Poussin. This was cut in the block by John Byfield. All these
                materials are included in our reproductions of Thornton's Virgil. In addition, the
                relief etching of four designs, the woodblock of Blake's first wood engraving, and
                the pre-publication proofs of two groups of designs before they were separated are
                available under Related Works in the Archive on the Show Me menu for Objects 5-7.
                <lb/><lb/> Twenty of Blake's preliminary drawings for his wood engravings, all
                executed in monochrome wash, were sold at auction from the Linnell collection in
                1918. These are now widely dispersed; seven are untraced and one drawing in the
                group was not engraved. We are now publishing a selection of twelve of these drawings
                and plan to add more as they become available. <lb/><lb/> Although small in size and
                almost rejected by the man who commissioned them, Blake's Virgil wood engravings
                have been among his most influential works. The young artists who gathered around
                Blake in his final years, including Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward
                Calvert, were deeply inspired by the Virgil engravings. Palmer called them "visions
                of little dells, and nooks, and corners of Paradise"—an encomium that ignores the
                darker implications of some designs. Several twentieth-century British artists,
                including Graham Sutherland, were also influenced by Blake's wood engravings.

He wears a knee-length gown and holds a crook in his left hand and a pan flute in his right.  At far right, Thenot also leans against a tree facing forward and slightly left.  A leafy branch arches over his head. He wears a long gown and rests his bent left elbow on the tree while extending his right arm to the left with palm facing up. On the background hills visible in the space between Colinet and Thenot, a small dog, a third figure, and at least three additional sheep are visible.  The dog, at left, leaps with head and front legs raised toward the male figure at right who holds a shepherd's crook in his left hand.  This figure, identified as Lightfoot in the text illustrated, faces forward and bends forward to the right.  Both arms are raised horizontally and both legs are bent, with the right leg extended in the air behind him. His mouth may be open. To the right of this figure, at least three sheep run to the right with heads turned back to the left, as if to look back toward the shepherd and dog.</illusobjdesc>

                            and may also wear shoes. Thenot's left arm is bent slightly upward at 45
                            degrees; and he holds a shepherd's crook in his left hand. His right
                            hand, fingers slightly spread, rests on Colinet's right shoulder. His

                    <illusobjdesc>A group of seven figures appears on the lawn of a large house with
                        multiple pillars and windows visible. Three gowned females dance in the left
                        half of the image. The leftmost figure holds a tambourine above her head.
                        The second figure from the left faces away from the viewer. The third figure
                        from the left faces forward with her arms bent upward. Two musicians sit in
                        chairs in the right half of the design. The figure furthest to the right
                        plays a violin. To the left, a female musician plays a lyre. A gowned
                        female(?)possibly a childstands to the left of the female musician. She(?)
                        bends slightly over and may hold onto a male(?) child to the left. He(?)
                        stands facing forward with both arms bent upward. To the right of the male
                        musician is a tree trunk, with what may be leafy branches spread
                        overhead.</illusobjdesc>

                            The two vessels on the right are larger wooden ships with multiple
                            sails. The second ship from the left is indicated (if present at all) by
                            only a few vertical lines. The third ship from the left has at least
                            three sails. The fourth ship from the left has two masts and five sails;
                            the rightmost mast is topped with a flag. The second ship from the right
                            has three masts and ten sails; each mast is topped with a flag. The ship
                            furthest right also has three masts topped with flags and perhaps nine
                            sails in total.</illusobjdesc>
