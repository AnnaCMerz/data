                <objnote><p>This impression is in the first state of two.  When sold at auction in 1935, this impression was badly damaged, including loss of some of the design at the top.  The print was restored shortly after its acquisition by Geoffrey Keynes at the 1935 auction.  Any imprint, if present in this first state, was trimmed off this impression.  An engraved loop, probably part of an inscription, below and to the right of the "B" of "JOB" in the title inscription appears just above the bottom margin of this impression. This loop does not correspond to any part of the lettering of the inscription below the title (beginning "What is Man...") in the second state.</p></objnote>

                        Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of several tree trunks.  Job, the rightmost male figure, faces forward and lifts his head to look up with raised eyes. He is old with long hair and a beard, and he wears a gown. Both arms are slightly bent and at his sides with palms facing up and forward, fingers spread.  His knees are bent upward toward his chest. Job's wife, the second figure from the right, is a gowned female who sits facing forward but turns her head to look right toward Job with raised eyes. She has long curly hair and wears sandals. Her mouth is open.  Her knees are bent forward toward her chest, and she wraps both bent arms around her knees with her hands together, fingers intertwined, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. Only the head and one hand of the third figure from the right, who is male, are visible.  This is probably Zophar.  He faces forward and right and appears to have a mustache. One of his hands is raised in front of the left side of his face. He may rest his head on his raised hand, as his head is bent forward slightly. The second male figure from left is probably Bildad.  He has short curly hair and a beard and sits facing forward and right. Most of his body is obscured by the figure sitting in front of him, though he may wear a gown. He appears to bend forward and to the right slightly. The leftmost figure is probably Eliphaz.  He is gowned, or wears a shirt and cloak, and sits facing right with his knees bent beneath him and upper body bent or hunched forward.  He is old and has long hair and a beard. His right arm is at his side but bent upward, perhaps to rest on his left forearm. He points to the right with his right index finger, which appears to be extended through his beard.  His left arm is also bent and may rest in his lap. The ground on which the five figures sit may be covered in straw or other long grass. Behind the group of five figures, at least five tree trunks are visible. The third trunk from the left has a single bifurcated branch that extends to the left.</illusobjdesc>

                        <characteristic>praying</characteristic>
                        <illusobjdesc>Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of several tree trunks. Job's wife, the second figure from the right, is a gowned female figure who sits facing forward but turns her head to look right toward her companion with raised eyes. She has long curly hair and wears sandals. Her mouth is open. Her knees are bent forward toward her chest, and she wraps both bent arms around her knees with her hands together, fingers intertwined, perhaps in a gesture of prayer.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of several tree trunks. Only the head and one hand of the third figure from the right, who is male, are visible. He faces forward and right and appears to have a mustache. One of his hands is raised in front of the left side of his face. He may rest his head on his raised hand, as his head is bent forward slightly with eyes raised.  This is probably Zophar, given the probable identification of this figure in Blake's later series of Job designs.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of several tree trunks. The second male figure from left, who has short curly hair and a beard, sits facing forward and right. Most of his body is obscured by the figure sitting in front of him, though he may wear a gown. He appears to bend forward and to the right slightly, perhaps to look toward the figure at far right.  This is probably Bildad, given the probable identification of this figure in Blake's later series of Job designs.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of several tree trunks. The leftmost figure kneels facing right with his knees bent beneath him and upper body bent or hunched forward.  He wears a gown or shirt and cloak.  He is old and has long hair and a beard. His right arm is at his side but bent upward, perhaps to rest on his left forearm. He points to the right with his right index finger, which appears to be extended through his beard.  His left arm is also bent and may rest in his lap.  This is probably Eliphaz, given the probable identification of this figure in Blake's later series of Job designs.</illusobjdesc>
