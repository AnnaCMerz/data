            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen
                separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are
                housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert
                N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and
                Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art,
                Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and
                    <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all
                previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a
                printmaker. <lb/>
                <lb/> The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi
                    rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while
                still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving,
                the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i"
                    >The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope
                    in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the
                political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three,
                plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea
                    Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his
                development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other
                plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i"
                    >Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to
                Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi
                    rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as
                book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique,
                separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium,
                changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi>
                etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the
                Illuminated Books in the Archive. <lb/>
                <lb/> Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake
                returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the
                interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some
                plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of
                    Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i"
                    >Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>,
                and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury
                    Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication
                of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's
                development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several
                decades. <lb/>

                    <p>This impression is in the first state of two. When sold at auction in 1935,
                        this impression was badly damaged, including loss of some of the design at
                        the top. The print was restored shortly after its acquisition by Geoffrey
                        Keynes at the 1935 auction. Any imprint, if present in this first state, was
                        trimmed off this impression. An engraved loop, probably part of an
                        inscription, below and to the right of the "B" of "JOB" in the title
                        inscription appears just above the bottom margin of this impression. This
                        loop does not correspond to any part of the lettering of the inscription
                        below the title (beginning "What is Man...") in the second state.</p>

                    <illusobjdesc> Five figures sit huddled in contracted positions in front of
                        several tree trunks. Job, the rightmost male figure, faces forward and lifts
                        his head to look up with raised eyes. He is old with long hair and a beard,
                        and he wears a gown. Both arms are slightly bent and at his sides with palms
                        facing up and forward, fingers spread. His knees are bent upward toward his
                        chest. Job's wife, the second figure from the right, is a gowned female who
                        sits facing forward but turns her head to look right toward Job with raised
                        eyes. She has long curly hair and wears sandals. Her mouth is open. Her
                        knees are bent forward toward her chest, and she wraps both bent arms around
                        her knees with her hands together, fingers intertwined, perhaps in a gesture
                        of prayer. Only the head and one hand of the third figure from the right,
                        who is male, are visible. This is probably Zophar. He faces forward and
                        right and appears to have a mustache. One of his hands is raised in front of
                        the left side of his face. He may rest his head on his raised hand, as his
                        head is bent forward slightly. The second male figure from left is probably
                        Bildad. He has short curly hair and a beard and sits facing forward and
                        right. Most of his body is obscured by the figure sitting in front of him,
                        though he may wear a gown. He appears to bend forward and to the right
                        slightly. The leftmost figure is probably Eliphaz. He is gowned, or wears a
                        shirt and cloak, and sits facing right with his knees bent beneath him and
                        upper body bent or hunched forward. He is old and has long hair and a beard.
                        His right arm is at his side but bent upward, perhaps to rest on his left
                        forearm. He points to the right with his right index finger, which appears
                        to be extended through his beard. His left arm is also bent and may rest in
                        his lap. The ground on which the five figures sit may be covered in straw or
                        other long grass. Behind the group of five figures, at least five tree
                        trunks are visible. The third trunk from the left has a single bifurcated
                        branch that extends to the left.</illusobjdesc>
