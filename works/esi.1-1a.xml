            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>

                <objnote><p>Although the figure is a close copy of an unidentified figure in Michelangelo's *Crucifixion of St. Peter* (Pauline Chapel, Vatican), the entire composition is usually credited to Blake as the designer.  The landscape setting is Blake's own invention.  This impression is in the first state of two; the title is taken from an inscription in the second state.  Blake's later pen and ink inscription lower right in this unique impression of the first state (see the Transcription) indicates that Blake based the figure on "a drawing by Salviati" (probably Francesco Rossi Salviati).  No such drawing has been traced.  Blake may have taken the figure from an engraving of Michelangelo's entire painting or the figure alone, without surrounding background, in an engraving by Nicholas Beatrizet.  The date of this first state is based on Blake's inscription added below the design in the second state: "Engraved by W Blake 1773...."  He may have printed this impression himself.</p></objnote>

                        A single male figure, identified as Joseph of Arimathea in the second state of the plate but not in this first state, faces forward and stands on rocky and sandy ground in front of a body of water, very probably the sea. He has a long beard and turns his head to look down and to the left. He wears a short tunic or gown as well as a hood-like Phrygian cap with a pointed top that falls to the left. Both arms are bent at the elbow and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, the figure grasps his left arm just above the elbow; his left hand rests on his right forearm and he appears to touch his right upper arm with a partially extended index finger. He bends forward slightly. The figure's right leg is straight while his left is bent at the knee. Several small rocks are visible to the left of his right foot.  His left foot may rest on a rock behind him or he may be stepping or walking forward. The rocky and sandy shore on which the figure stands extends behind him at right and appears to rise into a cliff. The sea extends behind the figure and to the left. There may be clouds in the sky upper left.
