                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdesc>The design shows the raised spirit of Samuel and four figures who react to his presence. In the right half of the design, Samuel faces left and stands or walks, striding with his exposed left foot. He wears a long-sleeved gown similar in color to his long white hair and long beard, giving him a ghostly appearance. The hem of his gown drags on the floor behind him, and the sleeve gathers in folds at his left wrist. Samuel's left arm is raised slightly, and he appears to point at the ground in front of the other figures. His head is down, and his eyes appear to be closed. The figure nearest Samuel is a female with long hair who wears a gown or skirt that leaves her upper body exposed.  This is probably the Witch of Endor. The figure kneels with her right knee on the ground and her left leg bent in front of her. She faces to the right and looks toward the ghost of Samuel, but her upper body leans backward slightly. The figure's right arm bends and appears to wrap around her waist, and she appears to hold a long object, perhaps a stick(?) or magical rod, in her right hand. Her left arm extends across her body and may point at the men to her right. Her mouth is open, and her facial expression suggests fear. A long piece of drapery extends from the figure's left hip, circles over her head, and floats behind her, along with part of her hair. Below this figure's left hand, in the center of the design, a man kneels on the ground in a contracted posture. He wears a robe or other draped garment that leaves his right shoulder and arm bare. Long hair and a beard cover much of his head and face. The man bends forward, hunches his shoulders, and lies prone on the ground with his legs drawn up underneath him, perhaps bowing before the ghost of Samuel. His left arm is crossed in front of his face and appears to support the weight of his upper body. His left arm is bent and extends forward, toward the ghost. The fingers of his right hand are spread, and he faces right and looks toward Samuel's feet. Behind the bowing man kneel two others. The male figure at right has short, curly hair and a beard. He wears a long-sleeved gown with a robe or other cloth draped over it. The man faces forward and to the right, looking in Samuel's direction with an expression of fear. Only his upper body is visible. His left arm extends to the right; the palm of his left hand faces outward, and his fingers are spread. He leans away from the ghost of Samuel. At left, a male figure with long hair wears a long-sleeved gown and a robe or other draped cloth. His body faces away from the viewer, but his head turns to the right as he appears to look toward the ghost of Samuel. His legs are bent, and his legs extend behind him. His lower right leg and right foot emerge from the hem of his garment. The man leans slightly to the left and raises his bent right arm in a protective gesture. His fingers are spread, and his palm faces away from the viewer. His mouth opens in an expression of fear. The scene may be set in a cave. The floor, walls, and ceiling merge together and appear to be made of stone or earth. The right side of the design contains dark shadows, behind Samuel and extending toward the left side of the figure nearest him. There is also a smaller shadow behind the pair at left.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>In the center of the design, a man kneels on the ground in a contracted posture facing right. He wears a robe or other draped garment that leaves his right shoulder and arm bare. Long hair and a beard cover much of his head and face. The man bends forward, hunches his shoulders, and lies prone on the ground with his legs drawn up underneath him, perhaps bowing before the ghost of Samuel. His left arm is crossed in front of his face and appears to support the weight of his upper body. His left arm is bent and extends forward, toward the ghost. The fingers of his right hand are spread, and he faces right but looks at Samuel's feet rather than at his face.</illusobjdesc>

His left arm extends to the right; the palm of his left hand faces outward, and his fingers are spread. He leans away from the ghost of Samuel.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Behind the bowing man kneel two others. At left, a male figure with long hair wears a long-sleeved gown and a robe or other draped cloth. His body faces away from the viewer, but his head turns to the right as he appears to look toward the ghost of Samuel. His legs are bent, and his legs extend behind him. His lower right leg and right foot emerge from the hem of his garment. The man leans slightly to the left and raises his bent right arm, perhaps in a protective gesture. His fingers are spread, and his palm faces away from the viewer. His mouth opens in an expression of fear.</illusobjdesc>
