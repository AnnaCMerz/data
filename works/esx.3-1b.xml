            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access

                        Two figures stand just right of center in a landscape that depicts hell against a background of darkness. The rightmost figure, who likely represents the Pope and may be a caricature of King George III, stands facing forward or walking to the left but turns his head to look to the right. He wears a three-tiered spiky hat or crown and a long gown. His brow is furrowed and he frowns slightly. His left arm is raised and bent in front of his chest, where the figure at left may hold his left hand (which is not visible). The figure at left stands, hovers, or walks behind the Pope and faces forward while looking slightly right. His left foot is raised and extended backward at right. He has short hair that stands on end, and his blue body appears to be scaly and nude except for a long cape. This figure likely represents Lucifer. His right arm is raised horizontally and extended to the right. In his right hand, he holds a spear horizontally with its tip pointed left. His left arm is raised slightly and with his left hand he holds the Pope's left hand, as if leading him to the left. The ground on which the central pair walks may be water or earth(?). What appears to be a pit of fire with seven figures inside is visible in the lower left corner of the composition.  The three with crowns are probably kings.  We see little more than the open mouth of the first figure on the left. Only the top half of the head of the second figure from the left is visible and faces forward. The heads and upper bodies of the third, fourth, and fifth figures from the left in the pit are visible. The third figure faces forward but turns his head to look right and up. He has long hair and a beard; his mouth is open. His right arm is raised and bent to the right with palm facing down. A serpent coils around his right arm and torso. The fourth figure from the left faces forward and left with his head raised slightly to look up. He has short curly hair and a beard; he wears a spiky crown and his mouth is open. His left arm may be at his side; alternatively, the large body of a serpent may wrap around his left side torso and extend to the right. The fifth figure from the left also wears a spiky crown and has short hair that stands on end. He also has a long beard. This figure faces forward and right with wide eyes and a frown. He may look toward the standing pair at right. Two final heads are clearly visible against the far right side of the pit of fire. The head of the sixth figure from the left faces forward and leans to the left.  One (closed?) eye is visible. The seventh head from the left faces forward and up, perhaps with an open mouth, to look toward the standing pair above. Tall flames and dark smoke rise behind the figures in the pit.

The figure at left stands, hovers, or walks behind the Pope and faces forward while looking slightly right. His left foot is raised and extended backward at right. He has short hair that stands on end, and his blue body appears to be scaly and nude except for a long cape. This figure likely represents Lucifer. His right arm is raised horizontally and extended to the right. In his right hand, he holds a spear horizontally with its tip pointed left. His left arm is raised slightly and with his left hand he holds the Pope's left hand, as if leading him to the left.</illusobjdesc>
