                <illustration type="plate" location="E">
                    <illusobjdec>Pictured in an oval frame in the center of the plate, a resting
                        figure — almost certainly Samson — lies unconscious and limp on the ground.
                        He is muscular and bare-chested, and wears a cloth or loincloth around his
                        waist. His body faces left, and his face faces forward and tilts slightly to
                        the right. His head, with curly hair, rests against his bare left shoulder.
                        His eyes are closed. His left arm bends ninety degrees at elbow so that his
                        clenched fist rests on his lap, while his right forearm extends over his
                        right thigh. One finger of his right hand is pointed, as the hand drapes
                        over his inner thigh. Samson’s upper body is propped upright against the
                        legs of a woman standing behind him. This woman is most likely Delilah. She
                        wears a gown with a bodice or vest over her torso and has dark hair that is
                        pulled into a bun. She bends forward and reaches her left arm downward to
                        support or hold up the unconscious Samson. Her left hand is held behind his
                        back. Her head, turned to look behind her, is encircled with a strip of
                        cloth. She may be blindfolded. A group of three men stand behind her. These
                        figures may be the “fooman” in “The Monk’s Tale,” to whom Delilah sells
                        Samson. The central figure in the group wears the uniform of a Roman
                        solider, including a helmet and tunic. His body faces forward and his legs
                        are spread apart, with the left leg extended to the left and the right leg
                        bent at the knee (although it is mostly obscured by Delilah’s dress). He
                        twists his upper body to the right, and bends his right arm upward at the
                        elbow to cross over his chest. His face is turned downward and to the left
                        to look at the ground or, perhaps, at Samson. A cloak or cape billows from
                        his back to his left, and it may be worn by him or by the figure to his
                        right. To the right of the central figure, a man with long white hair looks
                        downward and to the right. His body faces right, and his left arm extends
                        outward to grab a curtain, visible at the edge of the frame. Only his upper
                        body is visible, but he appears to wear a tunic similar to that of the
                        central figure. To the left of the central figure, a third figure, likely a
                        male with long dark hair, faces the right. His upper body and face are
                        obscured by the central figure, so that only his legs are visible. His legs
                        are spread, with one leg extended backward and the other bent at the knee,
                        as if he is lunging. He appears to wear a tunic similar to that of the
                        central figure. A column is visible behind and to the left of the figures,
                        and they appear to stand or lay on a hard floor. A curtain or drapery
                        extends from the top of the oval frame to the lower third of both sides. The
                        oval frame sits within a backdrop that appears to be of bricks. Above the
                        oval frame, there is a stone or marble plaque. Below the plaque, there is
                        the statue or sculpture of the head of a figure, perhaps a female. Her long
                        curly hair extends to either side, and from both sides of hair two pieces of

                        two hooks on either side of the plaque. The ends of the cloth twist over
                        itself to form two loops on either side. A second plaque sits below the oval

                            resting figure — almost certainly Samson — lies unconscious and limp on
                            the ground. He is muscular and bare-chested, and wears a cloth or
                            loincloth around his waist. His body faces left, and his face faces
                            forward and tilts slightly to the right. His head, with curly hair,
                            rests against his bare left shoulder. His eyes are closed. His left arm
                            bends ninety degrees at elbow so that his clenched fist rests on his
                            lap, while his right forearm extends over his right thigh. One finger of
                            his right hand is pointed, as the hand drapes over his inner thigh.
                            Samson’s upper body is propped upright against the legs of a woman
                            standing behind him.</illusobjdesc>

                            pulled into a bun. She bends forward and reaches her left arm downward
                            to support or hold up the unconscious Samson. Her left hand is held
                            behind his back. Her head, turned to look behind her and away from the
                            viewer, is encircled with a strip of cloth. She may be blindfolded.

                            including a helmet and tunic. His body faces forward and his legs are

                            bent at the knee (although it is mostly obscured by Delilah’s dress). He
                            twists his upper body to the right, and bends his right arm upward at
                            the elbow to cross over his chest. His face is turned downward and to
                            the left to look at the ground or, perhaps, at Samson. A cloak or cape
                            billows from his back to his left, and it may be worn by him or by the
