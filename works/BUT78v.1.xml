                    <illusobjdesc>A male figure who has long hair and a beard stands or walks forward with both arms upraised.  He appears to point upward with the index finger of his left hand and turn his head slightly to the right.  He wears a long gown that ends in serpentine swirls of fabric around his feet.  There may be another prostrate figure in the foreground.  The upright figure's right foot is visible, suggesting he is stepping forward with this foot.  There are suggestions of other forms on each side and behind the main figure who may be a sketch of Christ at the Resurrection.</illusobjdesc>

He appears to point upward with the index finger of his left hand and turn his head slightly to the right.  He wears a long gown that ends in serpentine swirls of fabric around his feet.  His right foot is visible, suggesting he is stepping forward with this foot.  Rounded forms above his head may be an alternative position for the figure's head and shoulders.  Similarly, a few curving lines right of the figure's lower legs may be an alternative sketch for the lower reaches of his garment.  The figure may be a sketch of Christ at the Resurrection.</illusobjdesc>
