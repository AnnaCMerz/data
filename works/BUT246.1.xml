                    <illusobjdesc>Five figures fly or hover against a starry sky in this illustration of Shakespeare's play <hi rend="i">A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>. The rightmost figure flies right but turns to face forward with both arms bent and raised, with palms facing forward and fingers spread. The figure is male with short, perhaps curly hair and an open mouth.  He may be speaking and leading the other figures to the right. He wears a shirt, breeches, and a red cape or cloak; a sword is visible against his left hip. Both legs are bent slightly with his right leg extended backward at left. He is likely Puck, the sprite assistant to Oberon, King of the Fairies. In the center of the composition, a pair of figures fly to the right or hover. They are likely Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the Fairies in the play. Titania, the female figure at right, has long hair and wears a gown. Although she faces right, she turns forward perhaps to look toward her companion. Her left arm is straight and by her side. Her legs are together and extended horizontally at left. To her left, a male figure, likely Oberon, faces right. He has long hair and a beard and wears a crown, long gown, and red cape or cloak. With his right arm, which is bent and at his side, he holds a scepter. His left arm may be bent by his side, perhaps under his cape; he may hold an orb(?) with this hand in front of his lower torso. Both legs are together and extended to the left. To the left of this pair, two small gowned female figures, probably fairies, also fly right and hold the trains of the king and queen's gowns with raised, bent arms. The figure at right has long hair and may wear a garland on her head. She turns her head to look left, likely toward her companion, who also has long hair and wears a headband or garland on her head. Both figures extend their legs to the left. Below the five figures, there appears to be an area of dark ground or earth, and behind them, dark sky with stars, suggesting the time is night, perhaps at the conclusion of the play when Oberon and Titania lead the Fairies away and Puck concludes: "So good night unto you all./ Give me your hands, if we be friends,/ And Robin shall restore amends." (Act 5, Scene 1, 453-455).</illusobjdesc>

In the center of the composition, a pair of figures fly to the right or hover. They are likely Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the Fairies in the play. Titania, the female figure at right, has long hair and wears a gown with a belt.  She may wear a blue cloak, as evinced by the blue cloth held by the small figure to the left and a slender arc of blue below and to the right of Titania's left hip. Although she faces right, she turns forward, perhaps even slightly left to look toward her companion. Her left arm is straight and by her side. Her legs are together and extended horizontally at left.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Five figures fly or hover against a starry sky in this illustration of Shakespeare's play <hi rend="i">A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>. In the center of the composition, a pair of figures fly to the right or hover. They are likely Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the Fairies in the play. At left, Oberon faces right. He has long hair and a beard and wears a crown, long gown, and red cape or cloak. With his right arm, which is bent and at his side, he holds a scepter. His left arm may be bent by his side, perhaps under his cape or cloak; he may hold an orb(?) with this hand in front of his lower torso. Both legs are together and extended to the left.</illusobjdesc>
