                    <illusobjdesc>A single nude figure stands facing left in this composition.  A young man with short curly hair, he extends his right arm horizontally with fingers slightly bent and palm facing down.  His left arm is bent upward and held near his chest; he may point toward himself with his left hand.  Although his body faces left, the figure turns his head left to look forward, head tilted slightly to the right.  His genitals are prominent even in profile.  His left leg is bent at the knee and his left foot lifted slightly, creating a contrapposto stance.  This figural drawing might be an academic study of Robert Blake, William Blake's younger brother, or perhaps a self-portrait.</illusobjdesc>
