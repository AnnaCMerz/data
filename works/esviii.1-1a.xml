            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>

                        Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right.  The rightmost figure is nude with prominent genitals. He has short curly hair and turns his head to look to the left. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. Both arms are bent and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, he holds the haft of a sword, which is pointed upward. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. To his left, the middle figure turns his head to look forward.  He has long hair, a mustache, and a beard; he also wears a spiky crown.  He may be a king. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth are visible. He raises both bent arms upward and clutches his head with both hands. The fingers of both hands appear to be curled inward. This figure wears a cape or cloak that extends behind his thighs. He may also wear a sleeved shirt or breastplate. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. The leftmost figure stands with his body facing right and head turned to look left. He has short wavy hair that stands on end and a large mustache; he may also have a beard. He wears a shirt composed of small circles, which may indicate chain mail, and pleated breeches or skirt(?). His costume suggests that of a Roman soldier. His right arm appears to be raised and extended behind the figure to his right. He may hold the spear visible above the middle figure's head. Only the right leg and foot of the leftmost figure are visible. The three figures stand between two wooden vertical objects, which may a door frame, as there appears to be a small horizontal step behind the figures' feet. The ground on which they stand may also be made of wood. Above their heads in the background is a sky with clouds.

                        <illusobjdesc>Three male figures stand in a line with bodies turned to face right. The rightmost figure is nude with prominent genitals. He has short curly hair and turns his head to look to the left. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. Both arms are bent and crossed in front of his chest. With his right hand, he holds the haft of a sword, which is pointed upward. His left hand appears to be in a fist. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. Lines under his feet hint at sandals, but no straps are pictured.</illusobjdesc>

He has long hair, a mustache, and a beard; he also wears a spiky crown.  He may be a king. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, perhaps in an expression of fear. His teeth are visible. He raises both bent arms upward and clutches his head with both hands. The fingers of both hands appear to be curled inward. This figure wears a cape or cloak that extends behind his thighs. He may also wear a sleeved shirt or breastplate. His legs are together with the right leg slightly in front of the left. Lines under his feet hint at sandals, but no straps are pictured.</illusobjdesc>

He has short wavy hair that stands on end and a large mustache; he may also have a beard. He wears a shirt composed of small circles, which may indicate chain mail, and pleated breeches or skirt(?).  His costume suggests that of a Roman soldier. His right arm appears to be raised and extended behind the figure to his right. He may hold the spear visible above the middle figure's head. Only the right leg and foot of the leftmost figure are visible. Lines under his foot hint at a sandal, but no straps are pictured.</illusobjdesc>
