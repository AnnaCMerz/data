                <note>Probably inherited from Blake by his wife Catherine in 1827; probably acquired by Frederick Tatham upon Catherine Blake's death in 1831; acquired by George A. Smith and bound by him in "about 1853" (Bentley page 337) with other works by Blake, including the manuscript "Order" of the *Songs of Innocence and of Experience*; the volume offered, presumably by Smith, at a Puttick and Simpson auction, London, 3-4 July 1863 (&#163;15.15.s., possibly bought-in by Smith given the reappearance of the volume in the Smith auction of 1880); the volume offered by the dealer Bernard Quaritch, 1864 *Catalogue of Books*, item 6521, possibly on consignment from, or in partnership with, Smith (&#163;21); the volume sold by Smith, Christie's, 1 April 1880, lot 168 (&#163;66 to Quaritch); the volume apparently lent by Quaritch to William Muir, who used some works as the basis for his facsimiles; the volume offered by Quaritch, Oct. 1883 *Catalogue of Works on the Fine Arts*, item 10,252 (&#163;80), May 1885 catalogue, *William Blake's Original Drawings*, page 2, no item number (&#163;80), and 1887 *General Catalogue of Books*, volume 2, item 10,252 (&#163;80); the volume acquired by Bernard Buchanan Macgeorge between 1892 and 1906; the volume sold from the Macgeorge collection, Sotheby's, 1 July 1924, lot 133 (&#163;345 to the dealer E. Parsons &#38; Sons); the volume, possibly with some leaves removed, offered by Maggs Bros., 1924 catalogue 456, item 53, this print titled "Glad Day" (&#163;630); the volume acquired no later than 1927 by George C. Smith who disbound the volume and rebound this print with three other works by Blake, "The Chaining of Orc," "The Man Sweeping the Interpreter's Parlour," second state, and "The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder," third state; this print, bound with the three other prints by Blake, sold from George C. Smith's collection, Parke-Bernet, 2 Nov. 1938, lot 42 ($450 to the dealer A. S. W. Rosenbach acting for Lessing J. Rosenwald); given by Rosenwald to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., in 1943.  The print is now disbound and matted.</note>

                <objnote><p>This impression is in the second state of two. The first state is visible, when viewed with a strong backing light, under the coloring in the color printed impression in the Huntington Library. This first state lacks the inscription below the design. This first state was executed in 1795, the second state c. 1820-25. The inscribed date of "1780" probably refers to Blake's initial invention of the main elements of the design and perhaps also to the preliminary drawing, *Study for "Glad Day," "Albion Rose" or "The Dance of Albion*, dated in Butlin 73 to c. 1780. Blake's inscribed initials and date within the design were probably also added c. 1820-25. If however present in the first state, the inscription within the design is completely masked by color printing in both known impressions of the first state.</p></objnote>

                        The nude, muscular, male figure of Albion stands in the center of the design with his arms raised horizontally and palms facing out. He has short hair that stands on end and he faces forward. His legs are spread and his genitals are clearly visible. His right foot may rest on tiptoe on a stone. The inscription below the design suggests that Albion may be dancing. A large bat-winged moth is visible between the figure's legs and flies to the left. The ground (apparently a hill or mound rising from right to left) below may be covered with grass or other indeterminate vegetation. A second animal, probably a worm (note the reticulations) but possibly a caterpillar, is visible on the ground to the left of the figure's left foot. Lines extending outward from the figure suggest a burst of radiance, perhaps beams of light emanating from the figure. Clouds appear behind Albion's legs in the lower third of the composition. Vertical and diagonal lines in the lower right corner may indicate rain.
