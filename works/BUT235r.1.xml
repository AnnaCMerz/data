                        <illusobjdesc>The sitting figure rests his left elbow on a stack of at least
                            three books. One or two other books are arranged vertically, leaning to
                            the right, visible at the seated figure's left elbow. The edges of a few
                            pages of the vertical books may be pictured.</illusobjdesc>
