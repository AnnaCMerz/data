                    <illusobjdesc>The design, part of the wall painting in the sedilia above King Sebert's monument at Westminster Abbey, is a panel with a solid background (perhaps of stone?) and a narrow border, which contains beveling, two columns, and a plain arch. Inside the arch are four points of a decorative tracery, each containing a gilded trefoil design and terminating in a leaf. The two points nearest the arch's top are smaller and more compressed. In the center of the arching panel is a crowned man who represents King Sebert. The king wears a long-sleeved gown, a long robe, gloves, and a crown. His hair and beard are curly. The king faces forward and to the right, bending with his upper body toward the pillar at his right. His left arm is bent upward, and he points upward with his index finger. His right arm is bent with his forearm raised horizontally, and he holds a decorative scepter that extends from his waist over his right shoulder.</illusobjdesc>
