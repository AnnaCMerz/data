            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt><updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of
twenty-seven water color drawings produced by Blake between 1775 and c. 1790.
Blake’s activities as a water colorist from the mid-1770s through the next decade reveal
his increasing skills in that medium, ranging from apprentice work to original
compositions exhibited at the Royal Academy. Assignments from his engraving
instructor, James Basire, included the precise copying of tomb monuments in
Westminster Abbey (Objects 1-5). These water colors were later engraved, probably with
Blake’s assistance, as illustrations for Joseph Ayloffe’s Account of Some Ancient
Monuments in Westminster Abbey (1780), republished in volume 2 of the Society of
Antiquaries’ Vetusta Monumenta (c. 1789). This early contact with Gothic art
profoundly affected Blake’s later work as an artist and his writings on the history of art.
Shortly after his release from apprenticeship in 1779, Blake began to develop a series of
designs picturing major events in the history of England (Objects 7-12). He exhibited
one of these, The Death of Earl Goodwin (Object 9) or a more finished version of the
design, at the Royal Academy in 1780. This group of pictures may have culminated in
“The History of England, a small book of Engravings,” advertised in Blake’s prospectus
To the Public in October 1793. Unfortunately, no copy of that work has ever been
recorded. Blake developed at least one work in this series, Pestilence, Probably the
Great Plague of London (Object 12), into a slightly larger and more finished water color
(Object 14). Lear and Cordelia was probably executed as part of the history of England
series but is presented in the Archive under Water Color Drawings, Illustrations to
Shakespeare.
Blake’s early water colors include several designs with biblical subjects (Objects 6, 13,
15, 18, 20-23, 27). The most highly finished and important of these are three illustrations
to the story of Joseph and his brethren recounted in Genesis (Objects 20, 22, 23). These
were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785. One year earlier, Blake’s A Breach in a
City, the Morning after the Battle (object 19), had appeared at the same venue. Blake
was trying, by the mid-1780s, to establish his reputation as a “history” painter—that is, as
a specialist in themes taken from history, the Bible, and canonical literary texts such as
Milton’s Paradise Lost. In the eighteenth century, such subjects were believed to be
appropriate for the greatest artistic ambitions, but all of Blake’s exhibited works were in
water colors rather than the more highly regarded medium of oil painting.
Almost all of Blake’s water colors fit comfortably within the long tradition of water color
drawing, in which one delineates form by line and the tinting is confined within firm
outlines. Water color painting, a style developed by artists such as J. M. W. Turner,
allowed for a freer use of washes, unconfined by pen and ink or pencil boundaries and
without underlying washes laid in for modeling.

                    <illusobjdesc>On a base of stone blocks sits a wooden monument with a large, rectangular, paneled seat. On the side of the monument closest to the viewer, four posts extend vertically from the stone base and terminate in pointed, decorative finials. The exterior left and right walls(?) of the structure are visible just outside the leftmost and rightmost posts; these walls extend above the rest of the structure and may also be decorated near their tops. The monument's roof is decorated with five additional pointed posts that appear between four arches that feature trefoil designs below triangular points. The decorative tracery of each arch may be made of gold or gilded. Additional lower arches appear faintly inside the monument, forming its ceiling. The back wall of the monument is divided into four (stone?) panels. The third panel from the left features a decorative design. Two figures are painted onto the background panels, one on far left panel and one on the third panel from the left. The figures wear long-sleeved, floor-length gowns and robes. Both have curly hair and wear similar crowns, and both hold scepters over their right shoulders. The figure at left, who likely represents King Sebert, is bearded and looks downward as he faces right toward the other figure. The king at right, who likely represents Henry III, stands erect and gazes at the King Sebert, pointing toward him with the spread fingers of his gloved left hand. Three (stone?) figureheads are affixed to pillars near head-height of the two kings. All three have curly hair. The crowns on the two outer figureheads suggest they may be kings. The central head wears a pointed collar and a crown or hat resembling a miter, perhaps representing a bishop or even the pope. The design represents the north front of the monument of Sebert in Westminster Abbey.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The figure of a crowned man is painted onto the leftmost panel forming the back wall of the monument. He likely represents King Sebert. The king's long-sleeved gown extends to the floor and is partially covered by a long, flowing robe with a bordered, curling hem. His hair and beard are curly, and he wears crown decorated with leaves or crosses. The king faces forward and to the right, bending with his upper body toward the pillar at his right with his head and eyes downward. His left arm is bent upward. His right arm is bent with his forearm raised horizontally, and he holds in his right hand a scepter that extends from his waist over his right shoulder, where it may rest.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>The painted figure of another crowned man, who likely represents Henry III, is visible on the third background panel from the left. He wears a long-sleeved, floor-length robe secured at the waist with a belt or cord. A bordered robe covers his shoulders but remains open in front. This king wears a crown atop short, curly hair. He faces forward, but his head turns to the left, and he appears to gaze toward the other king. He points toward this figure with his raised left hand. His fingers are spread, and he wears a glove that may be decorated with a cross or other emblem. His right arm is bent slightly at his side, and his right gloved hand holds a scepter that extends over (and may rest on) his right shoulder.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>Three figureheads, perhaps made of stone, adorn the monument near head-height of the two larger figures. The central head adorns the downward point where two decorative arches meet. The shape of this head, as well as its headwear, differentiate it from the other two figureheads. Below the head extends a large, pointed collar, and atop its curly head sits a crown or hat that resembles a miter. This headwear suggests that the figure may represent a bishop or even the pope.</illusobjdesc>
