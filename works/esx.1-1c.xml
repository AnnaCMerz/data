                    <illusobjdesc>
                        Two figures stand just right of center in a landscape that appears to depict hell filled with fire and smoke. The rightmost figure, who likely represents the Pope and may be a caricature of King George III, stands facing forward or walking to the left but turns his head to look to the right. He wears a three-tiered spiky hat and a long gown. His brow is furrowed and he frowns slightly. His left arm is raised and bent in front of his chest. He appears to wear a shackle around his left wrist; the connecting chain is held by the figure at the left. The figure at left stands, hovers, or walks behind the Pope and faces forward while looking slightly right. His left foot is raised and extended backward at right. He has short, flame-like hair that stands on end, and his body appears to be nude but covered with scales. This figure likely represents Lucifer. His right arm is raised horizontally and extended to the right. In his right hand, he holds a spear horizontally with its tip pointed left. His left arm is raised slightly and in his left hand he holds the length of chain connected to the Pope's shackle, as if leading him to the left. What appears to be a pit of fire with seven figures inside is visible in the lower left corner of the composition.  They probably all represent monarchs and their soldiers. Only the heads of the two leftmost figures in the pit are visible: the mouth of the leftmost figure is open while only the top of the head and eyes of the second figure from left (who may wear a helmet or hat) are visible. The heads and upper bodies of the third, fourth, and fifth figures from the left in the pit are visible. The third figure from the left faces forward but turns his head to look right and up. He has long hair and a beard; his mouth is open. His right arm is raised and bent to the right with palm facing down. A serpent may coil around his right arm and torso. The fourth figure from the left faces forward and left with his head raised slightly to look up. He has short curly hair and a beard; he wears a spiky crown and his mouth is open. His left arm is at his side. His torso, too, appears to be wrapped by a serpent, whose body may extend horizontally to the right. The fifth figure from the left also wears a spiky crown and has short hair that stands on end. He also has a long beard. This figure faces forward and right with wide eyes and a frown. He may look toward the standing pair at right.  Only the helmet of the second figure from the right is visible.  A final head is clearly visible against the far right side of the pit of fire. This figure's head is turned to face up and its mouth is open. In front of the rightmost heads in the pit, the tail and one leg of a lizard is visible crawling on the body of the serpent(?). Tall flames and smoke rise behind the figures in the pit. Behind the two central figures against the right edge of the composition, a swirling plume of smoke(?) rises diagonally and may contain human and animal bodies. At least one human face is visible to the right of the Pope's hip. This face is turned to face up and right with wide eyes and an open mouth. A second figure may be depicted in profile above this head at right. This figure may also have an open mouth and long hair, which streams to the right. Above these figures, the head, upper neck, and mane of a horse may be visible in profile facing left. At the top of this plume, a tail(?) of a serpent(?) may be visible and curls to the left. Large clouds cover the majority of the background space in the middle of the composition.
