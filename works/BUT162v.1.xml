<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a
                digital edition of forty-three pencil drawings produced by Blake during his first
                decade as an independent artist, 1779-1790. Drawing lies at the core of Blake's life
                as an artist. Pencil was his preferred medium for sketching—more flexible, less
                expensive, and more easily corrected than pen and ink or chalk. Preliminary work
                with the pencil preceded more finished work, either as separate sketches for prints
                and paintings or as drawings underlying water colors. Blake's nineteenth-century
                writings on the arts testify to his conviction that drawing was fundamental to all
                pictorial expression: "The distinction that is made in modern times between a
                Painting and a Drawing proceeds from ignorance of art. The merit of a Picture is the
                same as the merit of a Drawing" (*A Descriptive Catalogue*, Erdman
                page 549); "Let a Man who has made a Drawing go on &amp; on &amp; he will produce a Picture
                or Painting but if he chooses to leave off before he has spoild it he will Do a
                Better Thing[.]" (*Public Address*, Erdman page 576); "Painting is
                Drawing on Canvas &amp; Engraving is Drawing on Copper &amp; Nothing Else…&amp; he who Draws
                best must be the best Artist…." (*Public Address*, Erdman page 582);
                "Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness, for I am really drunk with
                intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or graver into my hand…." (letter to
                William Hayley, 1804, Erdman page 757). <lb/>
                <lb/> Blake no doubt executed a great many more pencil drawings than those extant
                today. Sketches were not intended for exhibition or sale; most were probably
                discarded, while others may have been retained only because of more developed
                compositions on the other side of the leaves. Even the slightest and least
                aesthetically ambitious drawings offer insights into the origins and earliest
                realizations of Blake’s designs. These first thoughts on paper often tell us more
                about Blake’s habits of mind, when joined by eye and hand, than more finished works.
                Sketches are “the first fruits of [Blake’s] imagination,” as Geoffrey Keynes states
                in the introduction to his *Pencil Drawings of William Blake*
                (1927). <lb/>
                <lb/> The forty-three pencil drawings presented here, produced in Blake’s first
                decade as an independent artist, show his early debt to academic standards of
                precise copying and to the neoclassical emphasis on outline. The first four works
                may have been drawn while Blake was a student in the Royal Academy schools. Other
                sketches are preliminaries for some of Blake’s most important designs. Among these
                are the *Study for “Glad Day”, or “Albion Rose”* (Object 6),
                Blake’s iconic vision of the human form divine in energetic pose, and three sketches
                (Objects 34-36) for illustrations to *Tiriel*, the only group of
                finished drawings Blake composed for one of his own poems. Several sketches are
                early efforts at picturing events in the Bible, Blake’s main inspiration for designs
                throughout his life. This biblical cluster includes *The Resurrection of
                    the Dead* (Object 10), *Samuel Presenting Saul to the
                    People* (Object 15), and *Job’s Wife and Other Sketches*
                (Object 31). Other studies, such as *Ugolino in Prison* and its
                verso (Objects 21-22), reveal the beginnings of subjects also of lifelong interest
                for Blake. Only a few drawings for Blake’s illuminated books have survived, but
                studies such as *Sketches for “The Book of Thel”* and *A
                    Standing and a Recumbent Figure* (Objects 37-39) offer fascinating glimpses
                into Blake’s methods of graphic production and revision. <lb/>

                        to her right. The similarity of this figure to Job's wife in two of Blake's
                        more developed illustrations to The Book of Job, *The Complaint of Job:
                        "What Is Man that Thou Shouldest Try Him Every Moment?"* (Butlin 164) and
                        the large separate engraving of "Job" of 1793, identifies her. Just above
                        her, rendered in very light pencil lines, may be another figure, sketched
                        sideways and with the head on the right, just above the feet of Job's wife.
                        This might be the frontmost of Job's friends, probably Eliphaz, in the same
                        two more developed renderings of Blake's Job illustrations. In the center of
                        the top half of the leaf, a male(?) figure with long hair sits facing
                        forward and right. He may be a shepherd sitting beneath a large tree. His
                        bent right arm rests in his lap where he holds a lyre between his legs. With
                        his raised, bent left arm, he may be holding a staff or shepherd's crook. On
                        the left side of the lower half of the design, a similar figure, but
                        possibly female, also sits facing right yet looking forward. Her long hair
                        appears to blow in front of her face, and she appears to wear a gown. Her
                        right arm rests in her lap, and she raises her left beside her face. In the
                        lower right corner, a rectangular space contains a pastoral design of a
                        seated figure, likely a shepherd, holding a staff or crook and surrounded by
                        various indeterminate vegetation. There is a second rectangular design
                        positioned just left of center in which a figure appears to stand amongst
                        tree trunks. Various other sketches appear throughout the leaf including a
                        right-facing profile in the lower left corner; a left-facing profile just
                        above the previous visage; a third face just above, rendered as only eyes
                        and eyebrows; another seated figure, sketches sideways near the center left
                        margin; a large face upper left, only the eyes and eyebrows clearly
                        pictured; and a seated figure upper right, sketched sideways. </illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>A seated figure is sketched sideways upper right, similar to
                            the seated shepherds elsewhere on this leaf. He(?) may hold a lyre
                            between his legs with his lowered right arm, like the large figure to
                            the left. His left leg is bent and his left arm bent upward. His left
                            hand may be touching his face, although his head is cut off by the edge
                            of the leaf.</illusobjdesc>
