                <objnote><p>These pencil sketches are on the verso of Blake's monochrome wash drawing, <hi rend="i">Job, His Wife and Friends: The Complaint of Job</hi>.  The sketch of Job's wife, sideways in the middle of this leaf of pencil drawings, is preliminary to Blake's two subsequent versions of the full composition on the recto, <hi rend="i">The Complaint of Job: "What Is Man that Thou Shouldest Try Him Every Moment?"</hi> (Butlin 164) and the large separate engraving of "Job" of 1793.

                    <illusobjdesc>Many figures and separate vignettes constitute this drawing.  In the center of the leaf is a sitting or squatting and contracted female figure, sketched sideways, with her body facing forward and her head turned to her right.  The similarity of this figure to Job's wife in two of Blake's more developed illustrations to The Book of Job, <hi rend="i">The Complaint of Job: "What Is Man that Thou Shouldest Try Him Every Moment?"</hi> (Butlin 164) and the large separate engraving of "Job" of 1793, identifies her. Just above her, rendered in very light pencil lines, may be another figure, sketched sideways and with the head on the right, just above the feet of Job's wife.  This might be the frontmost of Job's friends, probably Eliphaz, in the same two more developed renderings of Blake's Job illustrations.  In the center of the top half of the leaf, a male(?) figure with long hair sits facing forward and right.  He may be a shepherd sitting beneath a large tree.  His bent right arm rests in his lap where he holds a lyre between his legs.  With his raised, bent left arm, he may be holding a staff or shepherd's crook.  On the left side of the lower half of the design, a similar figure, but possibly female, also sits facing right yet looking forward.  Her long hair appears to blow in front of her face, and she appears to wear a gown.  Her right arm rests in her lap, and she raises her left beside her face.  In the lower right corner, a rectangular space contains a pastoral design of a seated figure, likely a shepherd, holding a staff or crook and surrounded by various indeterminate vegetation.  There is a second rectangular design positioned just left of center in which a figure appears to stand amongst tree trunks. Various other sketches appear throughout the leaf including a right-facing profile in the lower left corner; a left-facing profile just above the previous visage; a third face just above, rendered as only eyes and eyebrows; another seated figure, sketches sideways near the center left margin; a large face upper left, only the eyes and eyebrows clearly pictured; and a seated figure upper right, sketched sideways.  </illusobjdesc>
