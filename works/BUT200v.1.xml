                    <illusobjdesc>Two groups of figures stand facing each other on opposite sides of
                        the sketch. On the left, a gowned and perhaps partially hooded figure looks
                        right with an open mouth. This might be Tiriel. This figure may raise its
                        left arm diagonally to the right and extends one leg backward from the knee.
                        With its extended right arm, the figure touches or holds the neck of a
                        second figure who may be smaller in stature or seated. This figure (possibly
                        Tiriel's wife, Myratana) appears to have short hair and hold its right arm
                        by its side. At right, two figures, possibly Tiriel's sons, stand facing
                        left. The rightmost of these may have long hair or wear a hood in addition
                        to a gown. Both arms are crossed in front of his chest. The second figure at
                        left may have short hair or wear a hat with his gown. Both its right arm and
                        right leg are slightly bent. A few lines just left of the center-right edge
                        of the leaf do not form an identifiable motif. The scene is likely connected
                        with the monochrome wash drawing, *Tiriel Supporting the Dying Myratana and
                        Cursing His Sons* (Butlin 198.1), an illustration to Blake's manuscript
                        poem, *Tiriel*.</illusobjdesc>
