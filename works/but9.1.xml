            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt><updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of
twenty-seven water color drawings produced by Blake between 1775 and c. 1790.
Blake’s activities as a water colorist from the mid-1770s through the next decade reveal
his increasing skills in that medium, ranging from apprentice work to original
compositions exhibited at the Royal Academy. Assignments from his engraving
instructor, James Basire, included the precise copying of tomb monuments in
Westminster Abbey (Objects 1-5). These water colors were later engraved, probably with
Blake’s assistance, as illustrations for Joseph Ayloffe’s Account of Some Ancient
Monuments in Westminster Abbey (1780), republished in volume 2 of the Society of
Antiquaries’ Vetusta Monumenta (c. 1789). This early contact with Gothic art
profoundly affected Blake’s later work as an artist and his writings on the history of art.
Shortly after his release from apprenticeship in 1779, Blake began to develop a series of
designs picturing major events in the history of England (Objects 7-12). He exhibited
one of these, The Death of Earl Goodwin (Object 9) or a more finished version of the
design, at the Royal Academy in 1780. This group of pictures may have culminated in
“The History of England, a small book of Engravings,” advertised in Blake’s prospectus
To the Public in October 1793. Unfortunately, no copy of that work has ever been
recorded. Blake developed at least one work in this series, Pestilence, Probably the
Great Plague of London (Object 12), into a slightly larger and more finished water color
(Object 14). Lear and Cordelia was probably executed as part of the history of England
series but is presented in the Archive under Water Color Drawings, Illustrations to
Shakespeare.
Blake’s early water colors include several designs with biblical subjects (Objects 6, 13,
15, 18, 20-23, 27). The most highly finished and important of these are three illustrations
to the story of Joseph and his brethren recounted in Genesis (Objects 20, 22, 23). These
were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1785. One year earlier, Blake’s A Breach in a
City, the Morning after the Battle (object 19), had appeared at the same venue. Blake
was trying, by the mid-1780s, to establish his reputation as a “history” painter—that is, as
a specialist in themes taken from history, the Bible, and canonical literary texts such as
Milton’s Paradise Lost. In the eighteenth century, such subjects were believed to be
appropriate for the greatest artistic ambitions, but all of Blake’s exhibited works were in
water colors rather than the more highly regarded medium of oil painting.
Almost all of Blake’s water colors fit comfortably within the long tradition of water color
drawing, in which one delineates form by line and the tinting is confined within firm
outlines. Water color painting, a style developed by artists such as J. M. W. Turner,
allowed for a freer use of washes, unconfined by pen and ink or pencil boundaries and
without underlying washes laid in for modeling.

                        background and a narrow border, which contains beveling, two columns, and a
                        plain arch. Inside the arch are four points of a decorative tracery, each
                        containing a gilded trefoil design and terminating in a leaf. The two points

                        arching panel is a crowned man who represents King Henry III. The wears a
                        long-sleeved gown, a decorative belt or cord, a floor-length robe, and a
                        leaved crown. He has short, curly hair and slight evidence of stubble or
                        short facial hair. He faces forward, but his head turns to the left with his
                        eyes looking in that direction. He wears ornate gloves and rings on both
                        hands. His left arm is bent at the elbow and raised to the left, where he
                        points with his left hand. His right arm is bent and at his side; his right
                        hand holds a scepter over his right shoulder.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>In the center of the painted panel is the figure of Henry III.
                            He wears a long-sleeved, floor-length gown secured at the waist with a
                            decorative belt or cord. A hooded robe with an ornate border covers his
                            shoulders but remains open in front. King Henry wears a leaved crown
                            atop short, curly hair. His chin bears slight evidence of stubble or
                            short facial hair. The wrinkles on his forehead suggest a furrowed brow.
                            He faces forward, but his head turns to the left with his eyes looking
                            in that direction. His left arm is at his side and bent upward and left.
                            He points toward the left with his raised left hand. His fingers are
                            spread, showing a ring on his fifth finger. On both hands, he wears
                            gloves bearing large diamond-shaped emblems and decorative borders. His
                            right arm is bent slightly at his side, and his right gloved hand (also
                            showing a ring on the fifth finger) holds a scepter that extends over
                            (and may rest on) his right shoulder.</illusobjdesc>
