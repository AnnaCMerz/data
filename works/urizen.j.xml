            <updatestmt>
The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of Blake's <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> Copy J. This copy was acquired at an unknown time, probably in the nineteenth century, by the Royal Library, Vienna, and transferred in 1903 to the Albertina Museum, Vienna. However, it was not known to students of Blake until near the end of the twentieth century when the German Blake scholar and art historian Detlef Dörrbecker rediscovered it. This is the first time Copy J has been edited and reproduced in true-size, high-resolution images.                
<lb/>
<lb/>
Copy J is the seventh of eight extant copies of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> to enter the Archive, joining Copies A, C, D, and F, all color printed in 1794, Copy B, printed on large paper as part of a deluxe set of copies of illuminated books in 1795, and Copy G, printed c. 1818, when Blake resumed printing illuminated books after a hiatus of many years. <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen</hi> comprises 28 shallowly etched relief etchings, though only Copies A and B contain all the plates and only Copy G, the last copy printed, dropped the word “First” from its title page, acknowledging that the volume was not part of a series, which Blake appears initially to have envisioned. The story of Urizen continues in <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, the unique copies of which are in the Archive, but these books, both executed in intaglio and color printed in 1795, are smaller and much shorter.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy J, with 25 plates, was beautifully and extensively color printed—from both the surface and shallow portions of the relief plates—with Copies A, C, D, E, and F. The similarities and differences among impressions from the same plate can be examined by using the Archive’s compare feature, located under the image in the tab “Objects from the Same Matrix.” Impressions from <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> plates can often be juxtaposed to reveal the impressions that were printed sequentially and separately; for example, most Copy J impressions resemble very closely Copy D impressions, because the latter were printed immediately after Copy J from the same plates, without Blake reinking or replenishing the colors. Sequential impressions of this kind are referred to as “first pulls” and “second pulls,” the latter slightly lighter than the former. Printing two pulls per plate was common practice in color printing at the time and one Blake used in his other color printed illuminated books, as well as to produce the large color printed drawings of 1795.
<lb/>
<lb/>
With the publication of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> Copy J, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable digital editions of 107 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books. Users may view color corrected digital images at their true size, as well as enlarge and rotate images to examine the text and illustrations in detail. The images are accompanied by diplomatic transcriptions and editors' notes, as well as illustration descriptions that make it possible to search Blake's works for visual motifs. The Archive also provides full bibliographic and provenance information for each digital edition it publishes.
<lb/>
<lb/>
In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including 116 large water color illustrations to Thomas Gray's <hi rend="i">Poems</hi>, 537 large water color illustrations to Edward Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>, 101 water color illustrations to Dante’s <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi>, and over 80 water color illustrations to Milton’s <hi rend="i">Comus</hi>, <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, <hi rend="i">On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity</hi>, <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi>, <hi rend="i">Il Penseroso</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi>.
<lb/>
<lb/>
All works in the Archive are accessible via the Table of Contents, which is accessible via the "sandwich" button at the right end of the top banner. This drops down a second banner that identifies the categories of works in the Archive: Illuminated books, Commercial Book Illustrations, Separate Prints and Prints in Series, Drawings and Paintings, Manuscripts and Typographic Works. To further improve accessibility to the works, we've added a Table of Contents item, "All Works," which twice lists all of the works in the Archive without categorizing them according to medium. One list puts the works in alphabetical order and the other in order of composition date. The latter list would of course be of interest to any Blake scholars mindful of the historical progression of Blake's works.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Though the Archive retains its focus on the material conditions of Blake's art, presenting images in the context of works and copies, the newly designed site contextualizes each work, copy, and object in a network of relations. Users of the site can view each Blakean object alongside objects in the same copy, objects printed from the same matrix, objects from the same production sequence, and objects with similar designs. This contextualization, which draws on the expertise of the Archive's editors, enables comparisons across time, medium, and genre, and foregrounds the immense variety and the recurring themes of Blake's art.
<lb/>
<lb/>
As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.

                    <illusobjdesc>In a rigidly symmetrical composition, a willow-like tree with at most a few leaves forms a cave-like arch over the top half of the plate. The words of the title appear between the branches. A fully gowned old man with closed eyes and long, flowing white hair and beard, presumably Urizen, sits cross-legged on a large book in the center foreground. Centered behind him is a pair of stone tablets with arched tops, like tombstones. Indeterminate dark forms, perhaps another arching tree, appear above and on both sides of the tablets. Lying on the ground to the man's left and right are two sets of quadrangular stone tablets or books or, alternatively, the ends of a single long tablet, perhaps a coffin lid. The dark background of the bottom half of the plate, trees, and tablets taken together suggest a graveyard setting. Beneath Urizen's feet is an open book. The toes of his right foot emerge from his beard to mark his place in the book. Tree roots sprout to left and right in the foreground beneath the book and tablets. Holding a writing instrument in each hand and resting his arms on the tablets to his left and right, Urizen seems to be copying from the book onto the tablets. The instruments may be quills, graphite pencils, or etching needles. Publication information is centered beneath the book.</illusobjdesc>

Publication information appears between roots that sprout to left and right at the bottom of the plate.</illusobjdesc>

His body and left leg arc to the left; his right leg is bent toward the viewer, exposing the sole of his right foot. His arms are drawn back and his elbows are bent, as if the weight of his body is resting on his hands, which in turn are braced on what may be rock, earth, or clouds at the bottom of the design. His left leg is partly enveloped in a filmy, semi-transparent substance, perhaps clouds. His position, along with his streaming hair, suggests falling, floating, or hovering.

His head and hands are hidden by the rock; alternatively he may be headless.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>Two nude male figures, with tormented expressions and their legs drawn up toward their chests, sit in or in front of a wall of upward-swirling flames (left) and darkness (right). The emaciated, virtually skeletal, figure on the left looks upward while holding his arms at his sides and resting his hands on his knees. The figure on the right sits with head tilted back and his right shoulder twisted around to allow both hands to rest on the ground on one side. If the figure on the right is Los, the round object at bottom right is probably one end of the "great hammer" that "fell from his hand" when he "shrunk from his task" (Object 12, lines 22-24) after putting Urizen in chains. The figure on the left is shackled and chained around the ankles in this copy and thus may be Urizen.  Between the two figures is a pillar or tower leaning in an arc to the left, perhaps based on the famous leaning tower of Pisa.</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A nude figure with long hair, perhaps Los creating Enitharmon (or Enitharmon herself), bends forward toward the viewer over a large red globe that occupies the bottom half of the design.

Nerves, or sinews, or cords of drapery, or perhaps blood in veins stream over the figure's lower back and along what may be his legs on either side of his back. His hair cascades around the globe. The design may depict the "globe of life blood" that "trembled / Branching out into roots" to embody a "female form trembling and pale . . . the first female now separate" (Object 15, lines 2-11).</illusobjdesc>

                    <illusobjdesc>A tightly arranged group of three figures stands against a rocky cliff, perhaps covered by indeterminate vegetation. The figures, from left to right, are (1) a nude woman with long hair, her right arm at her side and holding some drapery in her right hand while looking down toward, (2) a nude child with short curly hair, probably male, seen from behind, who embraces the female with both arms; and (3) a bearded nude male, likewise looking down toward the child. A massive chain, probably "the Chain of Jealousy" (Object 18, line 28), hangs down the length of his body; its lower end terminates at his feet. The chain's upper end is attached to a large shackle or belt around his chest. He holds a large hammer with his right hand; his left arm is not clearly indicated, but may be raised horizontally. The hammer rests upon a pedestal or anvil. The trio likely represents Enitharmon and Los with the child Orc. A sun appears at the horizon on the left, colored to suggest sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

She is hunched over in a quasi-crawling position, a serpent coiled around her midsection.  Her long hair may fall over her face.

                    <illusobjdesc>Two human figures, probably representing two of the first four sons of Urizen, inhabit a compartmented landscape of sea, sky, and heavens.  These sons of Urizen likely correspond to the classical elements of air and water, with fire and earth being represented by Urizen's two other sons (not pictured in this copy): "first Thiriel appear'd...Like a man from a cloud born, &amp; Utha/ From the waters emerging...Grodna rent the deep earth howling...then/ Fuzon/ Flam'd out" (Object 20, lines 13-21).  Air/Thiriel: a male, with nude body in an upward curve, hovers mostly in dark red clouds over a rising or setting sun, a golden sky, and a dark sea.  Water/Utha: below and to the right, the upward-looking head of a long-haired figure of uncertain sex, but apparently male, emerges from the water.</illusobjdesc>
