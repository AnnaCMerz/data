            <pennednumbers>none<note>In addition to Blake's own inscription within the design of
                  Object 10 (see Transcription), the margins and versos of Blake's water colors bear
                  several inscriptions in pencil, both numbers (apparently an attempt to sequence
                  the designs) and captions or titles above and below the designs. Transcriptions
                  are given in Butlin 829.1-19, in G. E. Bentley, Jr., "The Inscriptions on Blake's
                  Designs to *Pilgrim's Progress*," *Blake Newsletter* 6.2 (fall 1972): 68-70, and
                  in Sotheby's auction catalogue of 14 Nov. 1996, lot 253. With the exception of the
                  title above the design of Object 23, these inscriptions are not shown in the
                  Archive's reproductions. We quote Butlin's inscriptions in the Editors' Notes to
                  each object. Butlin suggests "that some at least of the numbers may have been the
                  work of Blake himself" and tentatively attributes the title inscription on Object
                  2 to Blake, but does not attribute what he calls the "usual hand" that wrote all
                  others. Bentley, in his essay cited above, attributes all the inscriptions to
                  Frederick Tatham, but in our view his authorship is
               questionable.</note></pennednumbers>

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>A sleeping figure, presumably John Bunyan and therefore male, dominates
                  the design, lying on a small, grassy hill. He wears a long gown with sleeves that
                  covers his entire body, and has long, curly hair. His arms are folded under his
                  head, supporting it as a pillow. The right arm is tucked behind the left arm and
                  under the head, so that only the left hand is visible, and his head lies mostly on
                  the fold of the left forearm. Bunyan's body lies slightly diagonally across the
                  image, with his feet in the lower left corner and his head and arms just right of
                  the center of the image. He lies on his side, facing the viewer, and his face can
                  be fully seen. Only his right foot and leg is visible as the left leg is tucked
                  behind the right or the hill on which Bunyan lies. Bunyan is dreaming, with the
                  scenes of his dreams represented as an arc of vignettes superimposed on the
                  foliage above him. The hill under Bunyan is covered in grass and other foliage,
                  with individual tufts of grass visible. Just beneath Bunyan's knee, three ivy-like
                  leaves are noticeable, with lines indicating vines connecting them. A group of
                  circular leaves, shaped like a bunch of grapes, is visible below the right-most
                  ivy-like leaf. Beneath Bunyan and to the right, a sleeping lion lies in profile
                  inside a small cave, embankment, or hole in the foliage under the hill. He is
                  male, as indicated by the curly-haired mane, and his prominently large head is to
                  the left, resting on the ground between his forepaws, although only the left one
                  is visible. His tufted tail lies at his left side, and the paw of his left hind
                  leg is hidden behind the tail. A short, rocky cliff or embankment rises behind
                  Bunyan, covered in leafy foliage, of at least two different types: the circular,
                  grape-like leaves, and more triangular, pointed leaves. The foliage covers the
                  upper portions of the plate above the cliff. Superimposed on this foliage, a
                  rainbow-like arc of vignettes crosses the image, presumably the scenes of
                  Christian's journey which the sleeping Bunyan dreams. The leftmost vignette
                  consists of a walled and parapeted city gate, with a hunchbacked figure walking
                  away from the gate to the right with his right leg back and left leg forward, bent
                  at the knee; he carries a load on his back and appears to hold a walking stick or
                  staff in his right hand. The next vignette to the right consists of two figures.
                  The left-most figure stands with back to the viewer, legs outstretched with the
                  left leg back and the right leg lunging forward, bent at the knee. The figure's
                  left arm is raised over the head, and he appears to hold a shield in that hand
                  above his head. The right arm is down at the figure's side, but with the hand and
                  forearm extended forward, possibly holding a sword pointed upwards at the other
                  figure in the vignette. This figure looks at the figure to his right who faces the
                  first in an antagonistic stance. Its legs are spread wide and arms raised over the
                  head at 135 degrees, so that the figure makes an X-shaped stance. The figure has a
                  long, bushy mane of hair and beard which obscures the head. In the next vignette
                  to the right (at about the midpoint of the image horizontally), a figure stands in
                  profile under a large arch. The figure appears to be wearing a gown. A faint path

                  at chest-level of the figure is possibly the head of a second, smaller, gowned
                  figure standing in front of the first from the perspective of the viewer. The
                  final vignette is at the upper right corner of the image. This vignette is not as
                  clear as the others, but appears to consist of several spire-like structures, with
                  a few figures standing below them, indicated by three circular head-like shapes.

                     dominates the design, lying on a small, grassy hill. He wears a long gown with
                     sleeves that covers his entire body, and has long, curly hair. His arms are
                     folded under his head, supporting it as a pillow. The right arm is tucked
                     behind the left arm and under the head, so that only the left hand is visible,
                     and his head lies mostly on the fold of the left forearm. Bunyan's body lies
                     slightly diagonally across the image, with his feet in the lower left corner
                     and his head and arms just right of the center of the image. He lies on his
                     side, facing the viewer, and his face can be fully seen. Only his right foot
                     and leg is visible as the left leg is tucked behind the right or the hill on
                     which Bunyan lies. Bunyan is dreaming, with the scenes of his dreams
                     represented as an arc of vignettes superimposed on the foliage above
                     him.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian flees the City of Destruction, reading his book, most likely
                  the Bible, as he goes. Christian is shoeless and dressed in ragged, high-waisted
                  pants or tights and shirt, with ragged holes that reveal a muscular physique
                  underneath. He stands in stride, left leg forward, right leg back and both bent at
                  the knee, but hunched over because of a bulging load above his neck, shoulders,
                  and upper back. This load appears to be tied around his waist by a strap, but also
                  appears attached to him at the shoulders. His long, curly hair flows past his neck
                  under the load, and his head is bent so that he faces downward, looking at the
                  book in his hands. His mouth is slightly open, and his furrowed brow suggests a
                  melancholic or despairing gaze. His arms are bent at 90 degrees at the elbow, and
                  he holds the open book in his hands. He casts a dark shadow on the flat land on
                  which he walks. The city behind him and on the left half of the image consists of
                  square stone walls with some taller square buildings and spires rising up above
                  them. Directly behind Christian and to the right are distant trees of
                  unidentifiable type, represented by a couple clear trunks and bushy foliage. A
                  sloped hill rises above the trees in the background, and another domed building
                  can be seen behind the hill, although partially obscured. At the top of the plate,
                  a dark, billowing cloud, or possibly smoke, fills the sky. A few tongues of flame
                  reach out from behind the cloud, in the middle of the plate above Christian’s
                  back, and at the left of the plate right above the spires of the
                  city.</illusobjdesc>

                     likely the Bible, as he goes. Christian is shoeless and dressed in ragged,
                     high-waisted pants or tights and shirt, with ragged holes that reveal a
                     muscular physique underneath. He stands in stride, left leg forward, right leg
                     back and both bent at the knee, but hunched over because of the bulging load he
                     carries above his neck, shoulders, and upper back. This load appears to be tied
                     around his waist by a strap, but also appears attached to him at the shoulders.
                     His long, curly hair flows past his neck under the load, and his head is bent
                     so that he faces downward, looking at the book in his hands. His mouth is
                     slightly open, and his furrowed brow suggests a melancholic or despairing gaze.
                     His arms are bent at 90 degrees at the elbow, and he holds the open book in his
                     hands. He casts a dark shadow on the flat land on which he
                     walks.</illusobjdesc>

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>Christian and another figure meet just outside the gate of the City of
                  Destruction. Christian stands to the left with his body facing forward towards the
                  viewer. His head is turned slightly towards the other figure, but his full face is
                  still visible. He looks at the second figure, and his mouth is slightly open, as
                  if in an expression of surprise. His long hair is visible on either side of his
                  head and neck, flowing down behind his shoulders, and a few individual flame-like
                  locks of hair stand on end. He is shoeless and wears ragged, high-waisted pants or
                  tights and a tight-fitting shirt which reveals a muscular physique underneath. His
                  load is visible, bulging behind his head, neck, and right shoulder. His arms are
                  tight against his side, but bent at the elbow so that forearm and hands are
                  raised. His palms face out towards the viewer, and his fingers are spread. He
                  stands midstride with his left leg forward and that foot planted firmly on the
                  ground. The left calf and knee are particularly muscular. His right leg is back,
                  standing on tiptoe with only the first two toes on the ground. The second and
                  clearly older figure, presumably Evangelist, stands in profile on the right side
                  of the image. Only the left side of his face is visible as he looks down at
                  Christian. He has long, curly hair and possibly a beard, although it is obscured
                  by his left shoulder. He wears a long gown with long sleeves and visible folds
                  around his legs. His upper body is twisted slightly so that his back is partially
                  visible, and the gown is tighter here, revealing a muscular physique underneath.
                  His left arm is down at his side, and he holds a partially unrolled scroll in his
                  left hand. His right arm is raised horizontally and extended behind him, and his
                  right hand gestures towards that direction, fingers spread. He is perhaps
                  gesturing towards a beam of light above the large mountains in the background
                  below his hand. He also appears to be midstride, although not as dramatic a stride
                  as Christian's. His right leg is not visible under the folds of the gown, but his
                  left leg is, and it is extended slightly back. The foot protrudes from the hem of
                  the gown, with toes on the ground but heel raised. A large, arched gate stands
                  directly to the left of and behind Christian. The gate is pointed in a Gothic
                  style with three individual arches stacked on top of each other in tiers. The gate
                  appears to be open, as indicated by the absence of doors. Christian and Evangelist
                  stand on a flat, grassy, stretch of land in the foreground, but the background
                  behind them is filled with various hills, buildings, forests, and mountains.
                  Moving from foreground to background, the first level behind and to the right of
                  Evangelist is a dark forest, as indicated by three trunk-like shapes, sitting on a
                  grassy rise. Behind or slightly blended into these trees is a dark sloping hill
                  that falls to the left towards the center of the image. The next level behind this
                  hill is another, irregular hill that slopes from behind the gate on the left side
                  of the image downward towards the middle of the image, behind the first hill.
                  Behind both of these hills, a few structures are visible in the space between
                  Christian and Evangelist and between Christian's legs. The left-most structure
                  (between Christian's legs) consists of a square wall surrounding a square building
                  with a spire, perhaps a church. The next structure to the right is spherical and
                  protrudes from behind the wall, although the type of building is not clear. The
                  final structure is a trilithon whose left vertical stone and most of the
                  horizontal stone are fully visible, with the right vertical stone hidden behind
                  Evangelist. These structures are presumably part of the City of Destruction. The
                  space above these structures is filled with a red cloud, ending in a small tongue
                  of flame just to the right of Evangelist; therefore, the city seems to be on fire,
                  paralleling depictions in other objects. Behind the city, a mountain rises from
                  the left to the right, with one peak directly below Evangelist's right hand, and
                  another peak just to the right of and below the first. Bright beams of light are
                  visible in the sky behind the second peak, perhaps the rising or setting sun or
                  some source of fire. A few dark, smoky clouds hover around the light source and
                  above both peaks. This mountain is perhaps the volcanic Mount Sinai. Another
                  mountain rises behind this one from the middle of the image to the left, mostly
                  obscured by Christian and terminating behind the large gate on the left edge of
                  the image.</illusobjdesc>

                     here, revealing a muscular physique underneath. His left arm is down at his
                     side, and he holds a partially unrolled scroll in his left hand. His right arm
                     is raised horizontally and extended behind him, and his right hand gestures
                     towards that direction, fingers spread. He is perhaps gesturing towards a beam
                     of light above the large mountains in the background below his hand. He also
                     appears to be midstride, although not as dramatic a stride as Christian's. His
                     right leg is not visible under the folds of the gown, but his left leg is, and
                     it is extended slightly back. The foot protrudes from the hem of the gown, with
                     toes on the ground but heel raised.</illusobjdesc>

                     consists of a square wall surrounding a square building with a spire, perhaps a
                     church. The next structure to the right is spherical and protrudes from behind

                     visible, with the right vertical stone hidden behind Evangelist. These

               <illusobjdesc>Christian is shown fleeing the City of Destruction, pursued by two
                  figures, Obstinate and Pliable. Christian dominates the lower half of the image,
                  standing at the bottom of a series of grassy hills. Christian is shoeless and
                  dressed in worn, high-waisted pants or tights and shirt, with ragged holes that
                  reveal a muscular physique underneath. He stands in stride, with his right leg
                  bent at the knee and left leg extended backward, but hunched over to the point
                  that his right knee touches his chest because of a bulging load above his neck,
                  shoulders, and upper back. This load appears to be supported and bound to
                  Christian by a strap extending across his chest from his lower right torso to his
                  left shoulder. His long, curly hair stands on end in flame-like locks around his
                  head. He faces forward with his mouth slightly open and brow furrowed, suggesting
                  a melancholic or despairing gaze. His arms are raised horizontally and spread wide
                  with hands open and flat, fingers spread, and palms out toward the viewer. Two
                  figures chase after Christian, also in stride, on a grassy hill in the middle
                  ground behind him and on the right side of the image. These figures are presumably
                  Obstinate and Pliable, although it is unclear which is which. The right figure
                  stands slightly in front of the left figure, facing forward with left leg straight
                  and right leg extended backward. He wears a one-piece tight-fitting garment which
                  cuts off at the knees. His arms are raised vertically with fingers spread and
                  palms facing up. His short, curly hair flows behind him, and his mouth appears
                  slightly open. The left figure stands slightly behind and obscured by the right
                  figure, but he also faces forward with one arm raised vertically and mouth
                  slightly open. He stands with left leg forward and right leg extended back, but it
                  is unclear if he is wearing any garments. The City of Destruction fills the upper
                  half of the image on a series of hills extending into the background. From front
                  to back, the first hill slopes downward from left to right across the image, with
                  a tapered, cylindrical structure on the left side (similar to a cone with the
                  point removed), and three or four square buildings with pitched roofs on the left
                  side behind Obstinate and Pliable. The two left-most buildings in this group have
                  dark pentagonal openings on one side, and the right one of the two has a dark
                  roof. A Gothic church with tall steeple spires stands on the hill above these
                  buildings in the center of the image. On the level behind and to the left of the
                  church sits another cylindrical building in the center of the image and a dark
                  walled and turreted castle on a dark hill to the left. Another faint structure
                  stands on the far left of the image next to this castle, perhaps a pine tree or
                  some other cross-like structure. At the right and left edges of the plate, red
                  billowing clouds or smoke rise into darker ones that fill the sky at the top of
                  the image; a break in the clouds reveals a blue sky behind the topmost
                  buildings.</illusobjdesc>

                     He faces forward with one arm raised vertically and mouth slightly open. He
                     stands with left leg forward and right leg extended back, but it is unclear if
                     he is wearing any garments.</illusobjdesc>

                     hill slopes downward from left to right across the image, with a tapered,
                     cylindrical structure on the left side (similar to a cone with the point
                     removed), and three or four square buildings with pitched roofs on the left

                     have dark pentagonal openings on one side, and the right one of the two has a
                     dark roof. A Gothic church with tall steeple spires stands on the hill above
                     these buildings in the center of the image. On the level behind and to the left
                     of the church sits another cylindrical building in the center of the image and
                     a dark walled and turreted castle on a dark hill to the left. Another faint

               <illusobjdesc>Christian and Pliable are caught in the Slough of Despond outside the
                  City of Destruction. The Slough, a dark, murky body of water, perhaps a river or
                  lake, takes up the bottom third of the image. A few small waves break on the
                  surface of the water. Christian is shown in profile in the lower-left corner of
                  the image, doubled over on his hands and knees, crawling through the Slough. His
                  hands, forearms, knees, and lower legs are all below the surface of the water, but
                  faintly visible. His right arm is slightly ahead of his left, and his left leg is
                  extended backward. The outline of his right leg is barely visible, bent at the
                  knee and forward. His head, torso, upper arms, buttocks, and thighs are above the
                  surface. He wears tight-fitting clothes, including a long-sleeved shirt and pants
                  or tights, revealing a muscular body underneath. His load rests on his shoulders
                  and back, tied to his body by a strap around his chest. He faces downward, with
                  his long, curly hair hanging into the water. On the right side of the image,
                  Pliable crawls out of the Slough onto the shore. He faces away from the viewer,
                  toward the City of Destruction in the background, although his head is turned to
                  the left so we can see his face in profile. His left leg is forward and bent 90
                  degrees at the knee, with his foot on the shore. His right leg extends backward
                  into the water, breaking the surface at the thigh with the lower leg underwater
                  and not visible. His arms are spread on either side of his body, bent 90 degrees
                  at the elbows with his palms flat and on the ground, as if pulling himself out of
                  the water. He wears skintight clothing, including a shirt and pants or tights,
                  revealing a muscular body underneath. He looks off towards the left, perhaps at
                  the city in the distance or at a large black cloud or smoke. His short, flame-like
                  hair falls back onto his neck. A large, billowing black cloud or smoke runs across
                  the image from the lower-left to the upper-right edges of the plate, dominating
                  the sky in the upper left corner. The City of Destruction sits atop a few grassy
                  hills and ridges in the background, consisting of several distinct buildings
                  behind a large stone wall. From right to left, those buildings are a domed
                  structure with a cross on top; a square building with two tall square towers, one
                  with a large door-like opening; six short spires surrounding one tall spire,
                  perhaps from a church; a cylindrical building with a small, low, barely-visible
                  dome beneath; and a square building with two tall, skinny towers, perhaps the
                  turreted castle from earlier plates.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Help stands in the middle of the image, pulling Christian out of the
                  Slough of Despond. The Slough is depicted as a dark body of water spread across
                  the bottom of the image, perhaps a river or lake. Small waves break on the
                  surface, especially around Christian's body. Help is standing but hunched over at
                  the waist, reaching down to lift Christian. He stands with his body facing forward
                  and his right leg slightly in front of his left. His arms reach straight down as
                  he grabs Christian's arms above the elbow to pull him out of the water. Folds of
                  fabric flowing down to the ground on either side of him suggest that he is wearing
                  a cloak, and he appears to wear other skintight garments covering his legs and
                  arms, as indicated by the hemlines on his right ankle and both wrists. The garment
                  may instead be a long, semi-transparent gown. Muscular shoulders and thighs can be
                  seen through the garments. He has short, curly hair and beard and looks downward
                  at Christian, although his head is angled up slightly so that his full face is
                  seen. Christian is almost entirely submerged in the Slough, with only his upper
                  back, head, and arms above the surface. His body faces away from the viewer, but
                  he looks up towards Help with his head bent back so his face is visible, and with
                  his flame-like hair falling back onto his shoulders and upper back. His arms are
                  fully extended vertically above him, reaching towards Help, with his hands opened
                  and palms turned up. The fingers of his right hand appear to be spread. He also
                  wears a garment, as indicated by hemlines at his wrists. Help stands on a grassy
                  shore, and a series of ridges rises above him in the background of the image, with
                  a serpentine path curving behind him towards the left edge, then turning towards
                  the center and terminating behind Help. Large, leafy trees stand on either side of
                  the image, with three prominent trunks to the left of the path and another knotty
                  one to the right of Help. Above the trees, a dark, sloping hill or mountain falls
                  from the left edge of the image towards the right, disappearing behind the
                  rightmost tree. Above this tree and behind the hill spreads another flat, grassy
                  expanse of land, with a bright red sun either rising or falling behind this
                  horizon. Six rays emanate from the sun as beams of light into the dark sky at the
                  top of the image. The very uppermost portion is filled with several flat, dark,
                  overlapping clouds.</illusobjdesc>

                     Christian. He stands with his body facing forward and his right leg slightly in
                     front of his left. His arms reach straight down as he grabs Christian's arms
                     above the elbow to pull him out of the water. Folds of fabric flowing down to
                     the ground on either side of him suggest that he is wearing a cloak, and he
                     appears to wear other skintight garments covering his legs and arms, as
                     indicated by the hemlines on his right ankle and both wrists. The garment may
                     instead be a long, semi-transparent gown. Muscular shoulders and thighs can be
                     seen through the garments. He has short, curly hair and beard and looks

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>Mr. Worldly-Wiseman, a tall, old, male figure, stands on the left side
                  of the image. He has long hair and a long, bushy beard. He wears a loose, white
                  gown. He stands straight with his body facing forward, although it is angled
                  slightly so that he is not fully facing the viewer. His right arm is at his side,
                  but bent at the elbow so the forearm and hand are hidden behind his back. His left
                  arm is raised horizontally and extended outward, gesturing towards a fiery
                  mountain or volcano in the background of the image. Muscular arms and upper chest
                  are visible through his gown. His eyes look forward, instead of down towards
                  Christian at his feet. His left foot is barely visible, sticking out from under
                  the hem of his gown. Christian is stooped low at Mr. Worldly-Wiseman's feet. His
                  left leg is bent forward 90 degrees at the knee. His right leg extends backward,
                  also bent 90 degrees at the knee and almost touching the ground. He is hunched
                  over leaning on his left knee, standing on both sets of toes. He holds his book,
                  presumably a Bible, in his right hand just next to his left knee, and his right
                  arm hangs at his side, bent at the elbow with his hand resting on his left knee
                  and his index finger pointing to a page in the book. His face is seen in profile,
                  and he looks down at the book, reading. His long, curly hair falls back on his
                  neck and over his left shoulder. His load extends over his shoulders, neck, and
                  head. He is shoeless and wears a shirt and ragged pants or tights. Muscular thighs
                  and buttocks are visible through his pants. Christian and Mr. Worldly-Wiseman
                  stand on a flat, grassy stretch of ground, and a few layers of grassy hills rise
                  behind them in the background toward the foot of the mountains. A few bushes or
                  trees can be seen at the foot of the largest mountain and on the hill behind and
                  to the right of Christian. A large, tall rock rises behind Mr. Worldly-Wiseman up
                  to his waist, although it is mostly hidden from view. The background consists of
                  three craggy mountains. The largest of these, in front of the others and at the
                  right of the image, is particularly detailed with many crevices and ridges. Fire
                  and smoke burst from its peak, suggesting that it is a volcano. This mountain is
                  perhaps Mount Sinai.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian stands on a multi-tiered rocky outcrop resembling two steps
                  of a staircase, surrounded by flames and lightning. His body faces forward, and
                  his head is turned slightly to his left, but forward enough that his face is still
                  visible. His left foot is on the higher of the two rock steps, with the leg bent
                  at the knee so that the lower leg is folded under his thigh. His right foot is on
                  the lower rock step, with the leg extended. He stands poised on the toes of both
                  feet. His arms are close to his sides, and bent at the elbow so that the forearms
                  fold up against the upper arms. His hands are open, with fingers spread and palms
                  flat facing forward, as if in a stance of surrender or shock. His mouth is
                  slightly open, his slightly furrowed brow likewise portrays a shocked or fearful
                  expression. His long, curly hair is parted in the middle and flows down both sides
                  of his head, with the hair on his right side visibly flowing down his neck. He
                  wears a skintight shirt and high-waisted, ragged knee-length pants or tights,
                  revealing a muscular chest and thighs underneath. The bulge of his load is visible
                  behind his right shoulder. The majority of the image is dominated by large tongues
                  of flame and lightning. The most intense flames emanate from the top-right corner
                  of the image, spreading down and to the left towards Christian, as well as along
                  the top of the plate and down the left margin. Large, billowing clouds of smoke
                  flow from the ends of the flames along the left margin and the bottom-right corner
                  of the image. Two jagged bolts of lightning reach down from within the flames
                  towards Christian in the middle of the image. The mountainside is visible behind
                  the clouds of smoke in the bottom-right corner of the image. The mountain is
                  presumably Mount Sinai.</illusobjdesc>

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>Christian kneels in the center of the image, crouching hunched over
                  completely so that his head is nearly touching the ground. He is shown in profile,
                  viewed from his left side. He wears a tight-fitting shirt and tight, high-waisted
                  pants or tights, revealing muscular arms and thighs. His leg is bent sharply at
                  the knee, with knee on the ground, and lower leg tucked behind his thigh. The heel
                  of his foot is wedged against his buttocks and stands on tiptoe, with the first
                  two toes touching the ground. He is bent at the waist so that his torso is pressed
                  against his thighs. The bulge of his load is prominent over his shoulders, and is
                  secured to his body by a piece of fabric wrapped around his torso. The upper
                  portion of his left arm hangs down to the ground, so that his elbow touches the
                  ground. His arm is bent slightly at the elbow so that his forearm is stretched out
                  along the surface of the ground, reaching towards the other figure. His hand is
                  bent sharply at the wrist so that it stands up at a right angle from the forearm,
                  fingers spread, and palms facing the other figure, touching his hands. Although
                  his right arm is hidden behind his head and body, his right wrist and hand are
                  visible, and in the same position as his left. His head hangs low between his
                  arms, with his face hidden behind his left arm. His long, curly hair and crown of
                  his head are visible, and the hair covers his neck. His position suggests
                  supplication towards the other figure, as if asking for forgiveness. The other
                  figure is an old male, presumably Evangelist. He wears a long, flowing gown that
                  covers all but his head, hands, and right foot, although the gown is tight around
                  the shoulders and arms, revealing a muscular physique underneath. He stands on the
                  left side of the image, midstride in profile, with his right side visible. His
                  right leg is forward, with the foot flat along the ground and visible poking out
                  from under the hem of the gown. His left leg is extended behind him, and bent
                  slightly at the knee. He is bent forward at the waist towards Christian below him.
                  His arms reach down, with his hands touching Christian's hands. His left arm is
                  mostly hidden behind his right, but the left hand and wrist are visible. He has
                  long hair and beard, and his head is angled slightly so that both sides of his
                  face are visible. His mouth is closed and he looks down at Christian, with his
                  brows possibly furrowed in an expression of concern or consternation. The ground
                  below both figures is level and grassy. The right side of the image is dominated
                  by large, billowing, serpentine flames. They extend from the top-right corner
                  diagonally down towards Christian at the center of the image. A tall stone or
                  cliff face stands on the right edge of the image, though it is largely obscured by
                  the flames above and in front of it. This is perhaps the foot of the volcanic
                  mountain Mount Sinai. A large cloud of smoke extends across the top of the image
                  from the flames to the left, curving behind Evangelist's back, and ending in a
                  blunt point, resembling a jointed finger with the tip bent.</illusobjdesc>

                     bent sharply at the knee, with knee on the ground, and lower leg tucked behind
                     his thigh. The heel of his foot is wedged against his buttocks and stands on
                     tiptoe, with the first two toes touching the ground. He is bent at the waist so
                     that his torso is pressed against his thighs. The bulge of his load is
                     prominent over his shoulders, and is secured to his body by a piece of fabric
                     wrapped around his torso. The upper portion of his left arm hangs down to the
                     ground, so that his elbow touches the ground. His arm is bent slightly at the
                     elbow so that his forearm is stretched out along the surface of the ground,
                     reaching towards the other figure. His hand is bent sharply at the wrist so
                     that it stands up at a right angle from the forearm, fingers spread, and palms
                     facing the other figure, touching his hands. Although his right arm is hidden
                     behind his head and body, his right wrist and hand are visible, and in the same
                     position as his left. His head hangs low between his arms, with his face hidden
                     behind his left arm. His long, curly hair and crown of his head are visible,
                     and the hair covers his neck. His position suggests supplication towards the
                     other figure, as if asking for forgiveness.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>Christian kneels at the feet of another older, male figure,
                     presumably Evangelist. He wears a long, flowing gown that covers all but his
                     head, hands, and right foot, although the gown is tight around the shoulders
                     and arms, revealing a muscular physique underneath. He stands on the left side
                     of the image, midstride in profile, with his right side visible. His right leg
                     is forward, with the foot flat along the ground and visible poking out from
                     under the hem of the gown. His left leg is extended behind him, and bent
                     slightly at the knee. He is bent forward at the waist towards Christian below
                     him. His arms reach down, with his hands touching Christian's hands. His left
                     arm is mostly hidden behind his right, but the left hand and wrist are visible.
                     He has long hair and beard, and his head is angled slightly so that both sides
                     of his face are visible. His mouth is closed and he looks down at Christian,
                     with his brows possibly furrowed in an expression of concern or
                     consternation.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian stands in the middle of the image, knocking at a large gate
                  set within a tall wall. He is shown in profile, midstride, with his right side to
                  the viewer. His left leg is extended forward and bent at the knee, with the foot
                  flat on the ground and a muscular calf. His right leg is extended backward on
                  tiptoe, with only the first two toes touching the ground. He wears high-waisted,
                  ragged pants or tights, although they are tight on the thighs, revealing a
                  muscular physique. His right arm is extended forward, but bent 90 degrees at the
                  elbow. The right hand holds the knocker of the gate. He wears a long-sleeved
                  shirt, with clear folds in the fabric along his arms. The bulge of his load is
                  prominent behind his right shoulder and head, and it is secured to his body by a
                  piece of fabric wrapped around his torso. His long, curly hair flows down along
                  his neck and shoulders. He faces right, looking up slightly at the knocker. The
                  ground beneath him is flat and grassy, but a large stone or boulder sits to the
                  left of him, against the wall. The gate is embedded into a tall wall that spans
                  the width of the image. There is a tower, turret, or pilaster in the wall at the
                  left edge of the image, with a drawn bow and arrow sitting atop it. The bow is
                  aimed diagonally down and to the right at Christian. No clear figure holds the
                  bow, although there are some indeterminate shapes that could be a figure. The
                  gate, presumably the Wicket Gate, stands in the middle of the wall. It is tall and
                  arched, with a point in the apex of the arch. The door of the gate is surrounded
                  by a similarly arched and pointed doorframe, carved with faint vinelike shapes.
                  The door itself has a large, ring-shaped knocker in the top-center, perhaps a
                  sanctuary knocker, which Christian grabs. The bottom half of the door, below
                  Christian's arm, is divided into three smaller carved arches, also with points,
                  reminiscent of the Gothic style. The message "KNOCK AND IT SHALL BE OPENED" is
                  carved into the edge of the door's arch. with the first three words on the left
                  side, and the last three on the right. There is a small hole, perhaps a keyhole,
                  in the right edge of the door, just below and to the right of Christian's elbow. A
                  large, step sits at the foot of the gate. Behind the wall, a few steep rises of
                  land can be seen. On the left, there is dark and leafy foliage, indicating trees
                  or a forest. Behind this forest, the peak of a tall mountain can be seen, sloping
                  down to the middle of the image. To the right of the forest, a steep road or path
                  in the middle of the image leads to a small, square, flat-topped building with an
                  open door. To the right of the path, a steep cliff topped with a line of dense
                  bushy foliage--again suggesting trees--rises behind the wall. A large, round sun
                  either rises or sets behind this forested cliff, with beams of sunlight reaching
                  to the left across the top of the image towards the mountain and right towards the
                  top-right corner. Dark streaks in the sky suggest clouds to the left of the
                  sun.</illusobjdesc>

                     the knocker of the gate. He wears a long-sleeved shirt, with clear folds in the

               <illusobjdesc>In the center of the image, an old, male figure stands inside in open,
                  arched doorway. The figure, presumably Goodwill, stands tall and with his body
                  facing the viewer. He has long hair falling on either side of his face, and a long
                  beard covering most of his chest and torso. His head is surrounded by a circular
                  halo, and he stares directly forward, towards the viewer. He wears a long-sleeved
                  gown that completely covers his body except for his head and hands. His left leg
                  is visible beneath the gown, especially the kneecap and calf. His arms reach down
                  towards the other figure in the image, Christian, with hands open, fingers spread,
                  and palms facing away from the viewer, and one arm on either side of Christian as
                  if embracing. Christian stands midstride as he climbs the steps towards the door
                  and Goodwill. He is shown in profile facing right, with his left leg extended
                  forward, bent at the knee, and the foot planted firmly at the top of the step at
                  the foot of the door. His right leg extends backward, standing on tiptoe with only
                  the first three toes on the ground below the step. He wears a long-sleeved shirt
                  and high-waisted, ragged knee-length pants or tights, both tight-fitting so that a
                  muscular physique is visible, especially at the shoulders and torso. His load
                  bulges from behind his head, neck, and shoulders, and it is tied to him by a piece
                  of fabric that wraps around his torso and also appears to wrap between his legs
                  through the groin. He has long, curly hair flowing down his neck and shoulders.
                  His head is tilted up and bent back so that he looks directly up at Goodwill’s
                  face. Only his right arm is visible, and it is extended vertically, but with the
                  forearm bent upward, reaching towards Goodwill in an embrace. His hand is open,
                  fingers spread, with palm facing away from the viewer. The doorway that surrounds
                  the two figures is arched in a Gothic style with a sharp point directly above
                  Goodwill’s head. It is embedded in a wall, with a step at its base, which
                  Christian climbs. The frame of the door is carved with twelve gowned figures,
                  curving in serpentine curves, six on each side of the frame. Beams of light
                  emanate from Goodwill and inside the door.</illusobjdesc>

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>Two figures stand on the left side of the image, with a third seated in
                  a cage on the right side. The leftmost figure is presumably the Interpreter, and
                  this room is therefore likely in the House of the Interpreter, featuring the cage
                  of despair. He is seen in profile wearing a long, straight, long-sleeved gown,
                  with only his head, hands, and feet uncovered. He has short, curly hair, and his
                  head is angled downward slightly. He looks down towards the third figure in the
                  cage on the right. His right arm is down at his side, bent at the elbow so that
                  the hand and forearm are raised slightly. He holds two objects in this hand, one
                  of which is clearly a key, the other being a bulb-shaped object at the end of a
                  short shaft, possibly a second key. His feet are visible under the folded hem of
                  his gown. The middle figure is Christian, and he stands with his body facing the
                  viewer. His head is tilted slightly to his left and down, with long, curly hair
                  flowing onto his shoulders. His face shows an expression of concern or despair.
                  His eyes look down and to his left, towards the third figure in the cage. His
                  mouth is perhaps slightly open. The bulge of his load is visible behind his head.
                  He wears a tight-fitting long-sleeved shirt which reveals a muscular physique
                  underneath. His arms are at his side, but bent at the elbow so his forearms and
                  hands are raised. His fingers are spread, and his palms face away from the viewer.
                  He wears high-waisted short pants or tights which are cut at the knees in a ragged
                  hem. The pants are equally skintight, especially on his abdomen. He stands with
                  his legs close together. His left leg is perhaps bent slightly at the knee, and
                  the foot is turned out towards his left. The right leg, though seen head-on, is
                  also perhaps bent slightly at the knee, as it appears that his heel is lifted off
                  the ground, with his weight on his toes. The right side of the image is dominated
                  by a giant cage enclosing the rightmost figure. The cage is as tall as Christian
                  and the Interpreter, and about half as wide as it is tall. The cage is made of
                  four vertical bars and five horizontal bars, with the middle horizontal bar broken
                  in the middle so that there is a window for the prisoner’s face and upper body.
                  The two ends of that bar end in large spikes, and the two horizontal bars above
                  and below it also have vertical spikes reaching into the window. The intersections
                  of the lower three horizontal bars and the middle two vertical bars also have
                  large, circular bolts. There is a short vertical shaft in the middle of the cage
                  above the prisoner’s head, but it does not extend the whole height of the cage.
                  The figure in the cage is the aptly-named Man in the Iron Cage. He is seated with
                  his body facing the viewer. His head is tilted slightly to his right, with his
                  brows furrowed and his eyes looking down in an expression of despair. His hair is
                  short and curly. He wears an iron collar around his neck. He wears no clothes, and
                  his naked upper torso and shoulders are muscular. His arms hang at his sides close
                  to his body, with his hands at his feet. His knees and legs cover his lower torso.
                  His legs are crossed with his right over his left. He has prominent toes, and his
                  feet appear to be raised so that he is on tiptoe. He wears shackles around his
                  ankles, with links of chain hanging from both. He appears to be clasping the
                  chains of his left foot with his right hand. The walls of the room can be seen
                  behind the figures and the cage and are made of large stone blocks.</illusobjdesc>

                     his body facing the viewer. His head is tilted slightly to his left and down,
                     with long, curly hair flowing onto his shoulders. His face shows an expression
                     of concern or despair. His eyes look down and to his left, towards the third
                     figure in the cage. His mouth is perhaps slightly open. The bulge of his load
                     is visible behind his head. He wears a tight-fitting long-sleeved shirt which
                     reveals a muscular physique underneath. His arms are at his side, but bent at
                     the elbow so his forearms and hands are raised. His fingers are spread, and his
                     palms face away from the viewer. He wears high-waisted short pants or tights
                     which are cut at the knees in a ragged hem. The pants are equally skintight,
                     especially on his abdomen. He stands with his legs close together. His left leg
                     is perhaps bent slightly at the knee, and the foot is turned out towards his
                     left. The right leg, though seen head-on, is also perhaps bent slightly at the
                     knee, as it appears that his heel is lifted off the ground, with his weight on
                     his toes.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Two figures stand looking at a third figure sitting on a bed. The
                  rightmost figure is Christian. He stands fully erect, seen in profile, but with a
                  slight angling towards the viewer so that his chest is seen. His head, in full
                  profile, is bent down slightly as he looks at the seated figure below and to the
                  left. His brow is furrowed slightly. His long, curly hair flows behind his neck
                  onto his left shoulder. The bulge of his load is visible behind his left shoulder
                  as well. The load is secured to his body by two straps running diagonally from his
                  shoulders down under his armpits, crossing over his chest. He wears a
                  tight-fitting, long-sleeved shirt which reveals a muscular physique underneath,
                  particularly for left shoulder and arm. His left arm is fully visible, while only
                  his right hand, wrist, and the end of the sleeve can be seen, with the rest of
                  that arm hidden behind his chest. The left arm is down at his side but bent at the
                  elbow so that the forearm extends forward. Both hands are raised upward, with
                  palms facing out and fingers spread. He wears high-waisted and equally skintight
                  short pants or tights, which are cut at the knee with a ragged him and have large,
                  ragged holes on the thighs. His legs are together, with the left leg straight and
                  the right leg bent back slightly at the knee, so that the right foot rests on
                  tiptoe. The middle figure, partly obscured behind Christian, is the Interpreter.
                  He stands facing the viewer, wearing a long, loose gown covering all but his hands
                  and head. His head is tilted slightly to his right and bent down, and he looks
                  down towards the seated third figure at his right. He is an old man, with curly
                  hair and beard. His right arm is fully visible, down at his side, but bent at the
                  elbow so that the forearm crosses over his torso. His right hand is bent down,
                  folded over his left wrist, and partially hidden behind Christian’s right hand.
                  All that is visible of his left arm is the hand, which is crossed over his torso
                  and pointing towards the third figure, with his other fingers folded in. The
                  leftmost figure is the Man Who Dreamed of the Day of Judgment. He is seated on a
                  low bed, facing the viewer. His head is titled slightly to his left, and he looks
                  up and to the right towards Christian and the Interpreter. His mouth is slightly
                  open, and he is possibly speaking of his dream. His long, curly hair falls behind
                  his shoulders. He wears a long, long-sleeved gown which is tight around his chest
                  and arms, revealing a muscular physique underneath. His arms are down at his
                  sides, but bent at the elbow so that the forearms are straight out towards the
                  viewer, resting on his legs. His hands are clenched in fists resting on his knees.
                  He is seated with his legs together and drawn up, bent at the knee. The gown falls
                  in loose folds on either side and behind the legs, but leaves them uncovered. His
                  feet, with prominent toes, are touching and are flat on the floor. Behind the
                  seated figure, a large blanket or other bed covering is mounded up on the length
                  of the far side of the bed, but flows down over the edge of the bed to the floor
                  as well. To the left of the image, a large, white pillow can be seen at the head
                  of the bed. A large, billowing curtain surrounds the bed, with one side drawn up
                  and hanging along the left edge of the image. Behind Christian and the Interpreter
                  is the stone wall of the room, with a clear stack of carved stone blocks at the
                  right edge of the image, and three vertical posts or wall corners visible, perhaps
                  indicating a doorway or other opening into the room.</illusobjdesc>

                     a slight angling towards the viewer so that his chest is seen. His head, in
                     full profile, is bent down slightly as he looks at the seated figure below and
                     to the left. His brow is furrowed slightly. His long, curly hair flows behind
                     his neck onto his left shoulder. The bulge of his load is visible behind his
                     left shoulder as well. The load is secured to his body by two straps running
                     diagonally from his shoulders down under his armpits, crossing over his chest.
                     He wears a tight-fitting, long-sleeved shirt which reveals a muscular physique
                     underneath, particularly for left shoulder and arm. His left arm is fully
                     visible, while only his right hand, wrist, and the end of the sleeve can be
                     seen, with the rest of that arm hidden behind his chest. The left arm is down
                     at his side but bent at the elbow so that the forearm extends forward. Both
                     hands are raised upward, with palms facing out and fingers spread. He wears
                     high-waisted and equally skintight short pants or tights, which are cut at the
                     knee with a ragged him and have large, ragged holes on the thighs. His legs are

                     a low bed, facing the viewer. His head is titled slightly to his left, and he
                     looks up and to the right towards Christian and the Interpreter. His mouth is
                     slightly open, and he is possibly speaking of his dream. His long, curly hair
                     falls behind his shoulders. He wears a long, long-sleeved gown which is tight
                     around his chest and arms, revealing a muscular physique underneath. His arms
                     are down at his sides, but bent at the elbow so that the forearms are straight
                     out towards the viewer, resting on his legs. His hands are clenched in fists
                     resting on his knees. He is seated with his legs together and drawn up, bent at
                     the knee. The gown falls in loose folds on either side and behind the legs, but
                     leaves them uncovered. His feet, with prominent toes, are touching and are flat
                     on the floor.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian stands slightly right of the center of the image. He is
                  turned facing away from the viewer, but with his head turned to his left so it is
                  seen in profile. He has long, curly hair flowing down his neck to the top of his
                  back. His head is titled back slightly so that he can look up to the figure of
                  Christ above him. He wears a tight-fitting shirt, revealing a muscular physique
                  underneath. He also wears high-waisted pants or tights, equally skintight,
                  particularly around his lower back and buttocks. The pants cut off at the knee in
                  a ragged hem. Both arms are bent at the elbow and folded up on themselves, so that
                  the forearms and hands are raised. His left arm is close to his side, while the
                  right arm is held slightly away from the body. His hands are raised, palms facing
                  out away from the viewer, with fingers spread. His legs are together; however, his
                  left foot is planted with the weight on the toes and heel raised, so the left leg
                  must be extended slightly behind the right. His right foot is planted flat on the
                  ground. At his feet on the ground to his left is a large, round, stone-shaped
                  object, presumably his load which has been released from his back. A few tongues
                  of flame envelop the load. Above Christian in the top-center of the image is a
                  vision of a figure, presumably Christ. He is just a partial figure, with just his
                  head, chest, torso, and upper arms visible, with other body parts fading into the
                  clouds that surround him. He faces the viewer with arms raised horizontally and
                  outstretched as if crucified. His head is tilted down and slightly to his left, so
                  that he looks down upon Christian below him. His long hair is parted and flows
                  down both sides of his face and onto his arm on his left side. There are perhaps
                  faint outlines of a beard on his face. Christ is surrounded by billowing, smoky
                  clouds, and sharp, almost spikelike protrusions, perhaps beams of light, extend
                  from the lower portions of the cloud, six on either side of Christ. They are
                  perhaps beams of light. The ground in front of Christian forms a grassy mound. A
                  tree stands at the top of this mound, partially obscured by Christian, and
                  extending up towards Christ and merging into his torso, forming the vertical post
                  of the visionary cross on which Christ is crucified. The tree is covered in
                  serpentine, leafy vines resembling ivy which wrap around the trunk and extend into
                  the clouds and spiky beams of light, particularly on the right side of the image.
                  There are two vertical, thin posts on either side of the tree at the edges of the
                  image, with serpentine ivy vines winding up their height to as well. The roots of
                  the tree and the lower ivy vines are covered in tongues of flame. There is a
                  door-like opening at the bottom-left side of the mound, framed by a
                  trilithon-shaped doorframe. The dark interior of a cave within the mound can be
                  seen through the door. This cave is presumably Christ's tomb. The sky behind the
                  tree, the ivy-covered posts, and the clouds with the vision of Christ is filled
                  with even darker billowing clouds or smoke.</illusobjdesc>

                     to his left is a large, round, stone-shaped object, presumably his load which

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>The image is dominated by four figures: Christian and three angels.
                  Christian is the rightmost figure. He stands facing the viewer, but with his body
                  turned away slightly so that we see him at an angle. His head is tilted so that
                  his whole face is visible. His long, curly hair flows down his neck onto his
                  shoulders. His eyes are open wide as if in fear or surprise. He looks forward and
                  down, as if looking at a point on the ground between him and the viewer. He wears
                  a long, loose, long-sleeved gown covering all of his body except his head, hands,
                  and feet. His left arm is fully visible, and hangs down close to his side, but
                  bent at the elbow so that his forearm crosses over his chest and torso. His hand
                  hangs down slightly. His right arm is hidden behind his body except for the hand,
                  which holds a long, skinny rod, his walking stick or staff. His legs are together,
                  with the right leg straight and the foot planted flat on the ground. His left leg
                  is bent slightly back at the knee, with the heel raised and foot standing on tip
                  toe. A tall, skinny post stands behind Christian at the right edge of the image. A
                  serpentine, leafy, ivy-like vine wraps around the entire height of the post. The
                  next figure to the left is an angel standing in profile facing right, but with
                  head turned facing the viewer. Slightly pronounced breasts suggest that this
                  figure is female. She has long, curly hair which falls behind her neck. Her facial
                  features are vague, but she appears to be looking towards the viewer and her mouth
                  may be slightly open. Her head is surrounded by a halo. Her right arm is fully
                  visible and raised towards Christian’s head. She touches Christian’s forehead with
                  her pointer finger, and all other fingers folded into the hand. Her left arm is
                  mostly hidden behind her body, except her hand at her thigh, holding an object
                  which appears to be an unrolled scroll. She wears a loose, transparent gown. Her
                  legs are together, with her left leg straight and foot planted flat on the ground.
                  Her right leg is bent back slightly at the knee, with the heel raised and foot
                  standing on tip toe. Her large, right wing is folded up close to her body, with a
                  few individual feathers visible. The next angel to the left faces the viewer
                  head-on. She wears a long, transparent gown, with slightly pronounced breasts
                  suggesting that she is female. Her head is turned and tilted slightly to her left.
                  Her long hair falls behind her neck and shoulders. Her head is surrounded by a
                  halo. Her arms both hang down at her sides. Her hands hold some indeterminate
                  objects. They are loose, flowery, ragged or leafy shapes, perhaps Christian’s old
                  ragged clothes. Her legs are together, but crossed so that the right leg is in
                  front of the left and the calf and foot of the left leg are hidden. Her wings are
                  folded on both sides behind her, but with their top curve prominent on both sides
                  of her head, and a few feathers visible. The leftmost angel stands facing the
                  viewer head-on. She wears a long, transparent gown, with slightly pronounced
                  breasts suggesting that she is female. Her head is turned and tilted slightly to
                  her right and down, and she appears to be looking down, reading a book held in one
                  hand. Long, curly hair, flows down behind her neck and shoulder. Her head is
                  surrounded by a halo. Her left arm is down close to her side, but bent at the
                  elbow so that the forearm and hand are raised. Her hand is not clear, but appears
                  to be bent back towards her body. Her right arm is also down close to her side,
                  but bent at the elbow so that the forearm crosses over her torso. Resting on the
                  forearm and hand is an open book. Her legs are together, with the left leg
                  straight and foot planted flat on the ground. Her right leg is bent back slightly
                  at the knee, with the heel raised and foot standing on tip toe. Her wings are
                  folded on both sides behind her, but with their top curve prominent on both sides
                  of her head, and a few feathers visible. Her right wing is fully visible, but her
                  left wing is partially obscured by the middle angel’s right wing. At the far left
                  edge of the image, a few leafy branches reach up from the ground to about waist
                  height of the figures. The branches have long, flame or tongue-shaped leaves,
                  perhaps a laurel. The figures stand on a flat, grassy ground. A few lines in the
                  space beneath the left bush suggest a stone or other indeterminate object. Beams
                  of light emanate from the angels into the sky above, most visible from the left
                  and right angels. A thin, dark cloud runs along the upper margin extending from
                  the middle angel and becoming darker and slightly more billowing as it reaches
                  towards Christian.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>The image is dominated by four figures: Christian and three angels.
                     The leftmost figure is an angel who stands facing the viewer head-on. She wears
                     a long, transparent gown, with slightly pronounced breasts suggesting that she
                     is female. Her head is turned and tilted slightly to her right and down, and
                     she appears to be looking down, reading a book held in one hand. Long, curly
                     hair, flows down behind her neck and shoulder. Her head is surrounded by a
                     halo. Her left arm is down close to her side, but bent at the elbow so that the
                     forearm and hand are raised. Her hand is not clear, but appears to be bent back
                     towards her body. Her right arm is also down close to her side, but bent at the
                     elbow so that the forearm crosses over her torso. Resting on the forearm and
                     hand is an open book. Her legs are together, with the left leg straight and
                     foot planted flat on the ground. Her right leg is bent back slightly at the
                     knee, with the heel raised and foot standing on tip toe. Her wings are folded
                     on both sides behind her, but with their top curve prominent on both sides of
                     her head, and a few feathers visible. Her right wing is fully visible, but her
                     left wing is partially obscured by the middle angel’s right
                     wing.</illusobjdesc>

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>In the middle of the image, Christian climbs up the side of steep
                  cliff, the Hill of Difficulty. He stands facing away, with his back to the viewer.
                  He wears a long, loose, semi-transparent gown, revealing a muscular physique
                  underneath, especially on his back and buttocks. His arms are fully extended
                  vertically above his head, reaching for the top of the cliff. His hands hold onto
                  the top, and he attempts to pull himself up. His head is up, bent back, and turned
                  so that we see his face in profile. His eyes are raised so that he looks up to the
                  top of the cliff, with brows furrowed and mouth slightly open, in an expression of
                  exhaustion or despair. His long, curly hair flows down his neck onto his upper
                  back between his shoulders. His left leg is fully extended, with the foot flat on
                  a rock. His right leg is partially hidden by his torso, but is visibly drawn up
                  and bent at the knee climbing up another higher rock, with the foot planted flat.
                  He has many small, bloody scrapes and cuts all over his body. The cliff is a
                  solid, stone face dominating most of the image. It has several grooves and cracks,
                  with large boulders or rocks at the bottom of the cliff. The top of the cliff
                  curves down in the middle, forming a serpentine ridge. It is this lower dip in the
                  middle which Christian clings to and climbs. There is a noticeably smooth path or
                  road through the middle of this cliff. On the left side of the image, a gently
                  sloping hill runs right to the edge of the cliff, which falls suddenly down,
                  calling to mind the cliffs of Dover, although with reverse coloration as the hill
                  is white and the rocks dark. Two leafless, thorny vines grow on the rocks of the
                  cliff, one along the bottom edge of the image, growing in a serpentine but
                  generally horizontal pattern. The other grows vertically on the left edge of the
                  image. At the right edge of the image, another small, indeterminate shrub grows,
                  possibly a laurel. It has two thin, vertical branches covered in long, thin,
                  pointed leaves, shaped like tongues or flames. The plant bears several small,
                  round, berry-like fruits and/or flowers. A double-gabled indeterminate building
                  sits at the top of the cliff in the distance, perhaps the arbor which Christian
                  will reach in the next illustration. It is simply constructed of vertical walls
                  with a triangular, pointed roof. It has no door, but is open on the side facing
                  the viewer so that the interior can be seen. A low, horizontal object spans the
                  length of the interior, perhaps a bench. The second gable is visible behind the
                  first. An indeterminate, rectangular object or structure stands to the right of
                  the building, obscured behind the right side of the cliff face. It resembles a
                  tall, vertical stone or boulder, such as a menhir.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian rests at an arbor resembling a gazebo or small hut, but
                  constructed from and covered in vegetation. The arbor is simply constructed, with
                  three vertical sides forming and a triangular, pointed roof. There is no fourth
                  wall or door, so that the arbor is open and the interior fully visible. The four
                  corners of the walls are made from the trunks of trees that appear to be palms,
                  with a fifth tree in the center of the structure supporting the roof, although the
                  back right corner is obscured by Christian. The center and back-left trunks have
                  the distinct scaly bark characteristic of palms, and while the front two do not
                  have such visible bark, the long, thin, fronds branching from the tops of all
                  suggest that they are all palms. A few palm branches are bent down and hang from
                  the tops of the trees, resembling folded wings. However, the majority of the palm
                  branches grow upwards to form the roof of the arbor. A thin vine winds around the
                  bottom half of the central palm, with large, round flowers or fruits growing on
                  it. The bottom half of the back-left palm is also covered in similar fruits or
                  flowers, but the vine from which they grow is not visible. A large, fully blooming
                  flower sits at the point of the roof, with its own large, thin, leafy branches
                  growing downwards merging with the palm branches to complete the roof. The flower
                  has at least two tear-shaped petals, and three prominent stamens, pistils, or
                  other vertical protrusions. The leaves of the flower greatly resemble those of the
                  palm trees. The two front palm trees are covered in other indeterminate vining
                  vegetation that wraps around the trunks. These vines have thin, tongue or
                  flame-shaped leaves shorter than those of the palms. The back wall of the arbor is
                  covered in similar vegetation, most visible between the back-left and center
                  palms, but growing as vertical shrubs with freestanding branches instead of vines
                  growing on supports. The leaves are also thin and tongue or flame-shaped,
                  suggesting that these are possibly the same plant, perhaps a laurel. A few
                  similarly-shaped leaves are visible behind Christian’s left leg in the back-right
                  corner of the arbor as well. Another similar but smaller bush grows behind the
                  front-right palm tree, around that corner of the arbor on the outside. This
                  exterior bush has lumps of fruit or flowers growing at its base, similar to those
                  at the bases of the palm trees. A low, horizontal stone bench or pew is built
                  along all three walls of the arbor. It has carvings on its sides, most prominent
                  on the portions of the bench along the left wall and under Christian’s left knee.
                  The top of the bench is covered in a slimy semi-solid liquid, which appears to be
                  crushed fruits from the various plants within the arbor. Christian sits on the
                  right side of the bench, blocking the view of most of the interior of that side of
                  the arbor. He faces the viewer, wearing a long, semi-transparent, long-sleeved
                  gown which reveals a muscular physique underneath, especially on his arms, chest,
                  and legs. His head is held up, but tilted slightly to his left. His long hair
                  falls just above his shoulders. His mouth is open, and his brows are furrowed
                  slightly, indicating an expression of exhaustion or concern. His eyes are raised
                  and he looks up. His left arm is raised vertically, fully extended as if reaching
                  for the sky. The hand is raised and open, with fingers spread and palm facing out
                  towards the viewer. His right arm hangs straight down by his side, close to his
                  body. It is fully extended downward, and in his hand he holds a rolled scroll. He
                  sits with his legs spread. His right leg is straight and extended out to the
                  right, with the foot resting flat on the ground. His left thigh rests on the
                  bench, but the leg is bent at the knee so that the lower leg reaches down to the
                  ground, with his foot on tiptoe and heel raised. His body is covered in small,
                  bloody scrapes or cuts. The ground below the arbor and Christian is covered in
                  grass, with individual leaves especially noticeable at the bottom-left corner of
                  the image. The arbor sits atop a hill, as indicated by a downward slope in the
                  ground at the bottom-right corner of the image. A path or road runs the width of
                  the image just below Christian and the bench, separating the thin patch of grass
                  along the bottom margin of the image from that underneath the arbor and Christian.
                  A large rainbow fills the sky above the arbor, spreading across the entire width
                  of the image.</illusobjdesc>

                     The four corners of the walls are made from the trunks of trees that appear to

                     although the back right corner is obscured by Christian. The majority of the
                     palm branches grow upwards to form the roof of the arbor. A large, fully
                     blooming flower sits at the point of the roof, with its own large, thin, leafy
                     branches growing downwards merging with the palm branches to complete the roof.
                     The back wall of the arbor is covered in similar vegetation, most visible
                     between the back-left and center palms, but growing as vertical shrubs with
                     freestanding branches instead of vines growing on supports. A low, horizontal
                     stone bench or pew is built along all three walls of the arbor. It has carvings
                     on its sides, most prominent on the portions of the bench along the left wall
                     and under Christian’s left knee. The top of the bench appears to be covered ins

                  <illusobjdesc>Christian rests at an arbor resembling a gazebo or small hut, but
                     constructed from and covered in vegetation. The four corners of the walls are
                     made from the trunks of trees that appear to be palms, with a fifth tree in the
                     center of the structure supporting the roof, although the back right corner is
                     obscured by Christian. The center and back-left trunks have the distinct scaly
                     bark characteristic of palms, and while the front two do not have such visible
                     bark, the long, thin, fronds branching from the tops of all suggest that they
                     are all palms. A few palm branches are bent down and hang from the tops of the
                     trees, resembling folded wings. However, the majority of the palm branches grow
                     upwards to form the roof of the arbor. A thin vine winds around the bottom half
                     of the central palm, with large, round flowers or fruits growing on it. The
                     bottom half of the back-left palm is also covered in similar fruits or flowers,
                     but the vine from which they grow is not visible. A large, fully blooming
                     flower sits at the point of the roof, with its own large, thin, leafy branches
                     growing downwards merging with the palm branches to complete the roof. The
                     flower has at least two tear-shaped petals, and three prominent stamens,
                     pistils, or other vertical protrusions. The leaves of the flower greatly
                     resemble those of the palm trees. The two front palm trees are covered in other
                     indeterminate vining vegetation that wraps around the trunks. These vines have
                     thin, tongue or flame-shaped leaves shorter than those of the palms. The back
                     wall of the arbor is covered in similar vegetation, most visible between the
                     back-left and center palms, but growing as vertical shrubs with freestanding
                     branches instead of vines growing on supports. The leaves are also thin and
                     tongue or flame-shaped, suggesting that these are possibly the same plant,
                     perhaps a laurel. A few similarly-shaped leaves are visible behind Christian’s
                     left leg in the back-right corner of the arbor as well. Another similar but
                     smaller bush grows behind the front-right palm tree, around that corner of the
                     arbor on the outside. This exterior bush has lumps of fruit or flowers growing
                     at its base, similar to those at the bases of the palm trees.</illusobjdesc>

                  the viewer, with his back and arms seen head-on, but with his body twisted in such
                  a way that his legs are seen in profile. His head is turned to the left, so that
                  it is also seen in profile. His head is back slightly, and his eyes are raised so
                  he looks up and to the left towards a figure in the background. His mouth is
                  slightly open, and his wide eyes imply a feeling of surprise or fear. His long,
                  curly, hair extends back from his head, as if blowing in the wind. He wears a
                  long, semi-transparent, long-sleeved gown which reveals a muscular physique
                  underneath. His body is covered in small, bloody scrapes or cuts. His left arm is
                  raised vertically, fully extended, as if reaching for the figure in the
                  background. His hand is raised, with fingers spread and palm out, facing the right
                  side of the image. His right arm is extended downward, held away from his body but
                  at his side. He holds a short, thin rod or staff in his right hand, perhaps his
                  walking stick. His left leg is fully visible and extends backwards, with the heel
                  raised and foot barely touching the ground on tiptoe. The hem of the gown is
                  particularly billowing between his feet. His right leg is partially obscured by
                  his left, but parts of the thigh and all of the lower leg are visible. The leg is
                  extended straight downward and twisted so that the viewer sees the back of the
                  leg. The right foot is planted flat on the ground, with its ankles prominent. Two
                  tall, large, stone cliffs or outcroppings stand on either side of Christian, with
                  a smoother path or road in between them—largely obscured by Christian—leading up
                  to the top of a hill in the background. Two large lions lie atop the outcroppings,
                  facing forward. Both lions have curly, bushy manes and large, wide-open eyes. They
                  both look down at Christian below them. The left lion has a flat mouth, and one
                  large, clawed paw reaching from under its head. The paw is shackled, with one link
                  of a chain visible on the shackle. The right lion has a clear smile and more
                  prominently bridged snout than its partner. Both of its large, clawed paws are
                  visible reaching from underneath its head. Both of its paws are shackled with a
                  few links of chain visible as well. Two short shrubs grow on the flat ground at
                  the bottom of the outcroppings, one on either side of Christian. They have pointed
                  tongue or flame-shaped leaves and are perhaps laurels. The ground under the plants
                  is covered in grass. The path continues on the ground between these shrubs and
                  under Christian’s feet. A large building sits at the top of the hill in the
                  background resembling a castle. Large, square walls flank either side of a large
                  doorway or gate in the center of the building, with a triangular top. Similar
                  triangular spires form a parapet of sorts along the top of the wall on either side
                  of the doorway. A taller, rectangular structure can be seen behind the door and
                  spires. A figure, presumably the porter Watchful, stands in front of the building
                  to the left of the doorway, hailing Christian below. The figure stands straight,
                  facing forward. He wears a long, long-sleeved gown covering all of his body except
                  his head, hands, and feet. His head is faint, but he appears to have long hair.
                  His right arm is extended and raised at roughly 135 degrees. The hand is faint,
                  but there appears to be an indeterminate object held in it. The left arm is
                  extended out from the body and bent at the elbow, with the forearm raised
                  vertically. He holds a tall, thin rod or staff in his left hand. He stands with
                  his legs together and straight, and both feet appear to be visible below the hem
                  of the gown.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian leaves the Beautiful Palace, with Prudence, Charity, Piety,
                  and Discretion close behind. Christian stands midstride—albeit a short stride—at
                  the right of the image, facing right, but turned slightly so that the viewer can
                  see the front side of his body. Christian wears a long, loose cloak or cape, which
                  may drape over armor. Another figure follows after Christian, standing midstride
                  just behind him. The figure is of indeterminate gender, although based on the
                  long, curly hair and more feminine features compared to Christian, she may be a
                  woman. This figure is viewed in profile, facing right so that she(?) looks at
                  Christian. The left half of the image is dominated by the gate of a building,
                  presumably the Palace Beautiful. The gate is simple, with a semicircle arched
                  doorway, and a raised portcullis composed of six spear-like shafts, with prominent
                  pointed heads. The interior of the building can be seen through the doorway,
                  revealing a dark room. A faintly drawn and indeterminate figure sits on a chair or
                  stool in the middle of the room. The figure appears to be gowned, and so is
                  possibly female. She(?) sits in profile, and her head is clearly bent down. Her
                  arms appear to be held in front of her body in her lap, with elbows on legs and
                  forearms bent upward, so that she can hold her head in her hands, with one hand on
                  top of her head, possibly in a position of mourning or grief. Another
                  indeterminate figure stands bent over just within the gate, partially hidden
                  behind the left side of the frame. The figure appears to be gowned, and so is
                  possibly female. Her(?) head also appears to be bent down, expressing mourning or
                  grief. The wall of the building extends to the right of the gate, with a pilaster
                  projecting from it. A third faintly drawn and indeterminate figure stands leaning
                  against the wall to the right of the gate. The figure appears to be wearing a
                  long, loose gown, and so is possibly female. A horizontal line across her(?) torso
                  possibly indicates a belt or girdle. She stands with her arms are behind her back,
                  and her head bent down, possibly in a position of mourning or grief. A line of
                  short, bushy shrubs or trees with several short trunks forms a hedge extending
                  across the image from this pilaster to the right, behind Christian and the figure
                  following him. Behind the shrubs in the background, another portion of the
                  building can be seen, with a tall square wall, another pilaster, and topped by a
                  dome. An indeterminate structure stands in the far background on the right of the
                  image, just to the right of Christian’s shield. The structure appears to be made
                  of three short domes or large stones or boulders. Streaks of clouds and light
                  cover the sky and the wall above the gate, crossing the top of the image,
                  indicating a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>Christian leaves the Beautiful Palace, with Prudence, Charity,
                     Piety, and Discretion close behind. Christian stands midstride—albeit a short
                     stride—at the right of the image, facing right, but turned slightly so that the
                     viewer can see the front side of his body. Christian wears a long, loose cloak
                     or cape, which is transparent to the point that his body is fully visible
                     beneath. The garment parts at his torso, falling down on either side of his
                     lower body. Beneath the cloak, he appears to be wearing armor, as evidenced by
                     the greaves (particularly on his right leg) and a possible helmet. He wears
                     skintight garments of some type on his thighs, chest, and arms, as indicated by
                     a neckline and faint cuffs at his wrists, and revealing a muscular physique
                     underneath. However, it is not as immediately clear that this garment is armor
                     compared to his greaves. His head is turned slightly towards the viewer so that
                     most of his face is visible. It is tilted slightly down and to Christian’s
                     left, with his mouth closed and his eyes gazing ahead of him to the right.
                     Faint lines indicate that his long, curly hair flows behind his neck and
                     shoulders, and that he may be wearing a helmet or other headpiece. His right
                     arm is fully visible, and is held at his side but bent at the elbow, with the
                     forearm extended forward across his chest. His hand is very faintly drawn, but
                     he is possibly holding some indeterminate object. His left arm is mostly
                     obscured behind his torso, but parts of the forearm are visible, held close to
                     his side and reaching downward. The left hand is also faintly drawn, but he
                     holds a short, thin rod or staff in his hand hanging straight down towards the
                     ground. This is perhaps his walking stick, but a sharp point at the end of the
                     shaft suggest that it may also be a sword. A shield is strapped to his left
                     arm, as evidenced by part of the curve of the shield which is visible behind
                     the arm and shoulder. His legs are close together, with his right leg fully
                     visible in profile, straight with the foot flat on the ground. A prominent
                     kneecap and line around the calf suggest he wears a greave on this leg. His
                     left leg is only partially visible as it crosses behind his right leg, but it
                     is extended slightly backward, with the heel up and toes down.</illusobjdesc>

                     midstride just behind him. The figure is of indeterminate gender, although
                     based on the long, curly hair and more feminine features compared to Christian,
                     she may be a woman. This figure is viewed in profile, facing right so that
                     she(?) looks at Christian. She wears a long, loose, semi-transparent gown, with
                     the hem falling in many folds at the ankles. The figure’s right arm is fully
                     visible, down at her side, but bent at the elbow so that the forearm is
                     extended forward towards Christian. The right hand is raised, with faintly
                     visible fingers spread, holding Christian’s right upper arm, as if pleading
                     with him. The figure’s right leg is fully visible, bent at the knee with the
                     lower leg extended back slightly, heel raised and toes on the ground. The left
                     lower leg is straight with the foot flat on the ground.</illusobjdesc>

                     prominent pointed heads. The interior of the building can be seen through the

               <illusobjdesc>Christian leaves the Palace Beautiful, followed by a group of people,
                  presumably Discretion, Piety, Prudence, and Charity. Christian stands midstride in
                  the middle of the image, facing the viewer head-on. His head is turned slightly to
                  his right, but his entire face is still visible. His long, curly hair flows behind
                  his neck and shoulders. He wears a headpiece, such as a helmet, cowl, which wraps
                  around his head and covers his entire neck. The top of the helmet above
                  Christian’s forehead has a pattern cut into it resembling a thin crown. Christian
                  wears a long, loose cloak or cape, which is transparent to the point that his body
                  is fully visible beneath. The garment parts at his torso, falling down on either
                  side of his lower body. Beneath the cloak, he wears armor, which covers his entire
                  body. There appear to be creases indicating separate plates of armor at his
                  wrists, just below his shoulders, and at his collarbone just below the neckpiece.
                  The armor is skintight, indicating a muscular physique, especially on his torso
                  and lower legs. His arms are both held close to his body at his sides. His right
                  arm reaches downward, fully extended. His hand is open, with the palm facing the
                  viewer and fingers spread. His left arm is bent upward at the elbow so that his
                  forearm is raised. In this hand he holds a large, round shield, presumably the
                  Shield of Faith. A sword is strapped to his left hip, as evidenced by the hilt
                  with prominent pommel visible below his left arm. The rest of the sword is hidden
                  behind his body. Although he faces forward, he is clearly midstride as his left
                  leg is extended backward and bent at the knee, with the foot on tiptoe. From the
                  viewing angle, his right leg appears to be straight, but it may be extended
                  forward towards the viewer slightly, with the foot planted on the ground, also
                  possibly on its toes. One figure stands to Christian’s left. The figure wears a
                  long, loose, semi-transparent gown, and slightly pronounced breasts suggest that
                  she is female. She faces the viewer, with her head turned slightly to her right,
                  looking at Christian. Her long, curly hair falls behind her neck and shoulders.
                  She has a halo surrounding her head with four prominent beams of light reaching
                  out from the halo. Both arms are at her sides, reaching down and fully extended,
                  with palms facing the viewer and fingers spread. Like Christian, although she
                  faces forward, she is clearly midstride as her right leg is clearly extended
                  backward, but the foot is hidden by the gown. From the viewing angle, her left leg
                  appears to be straight, but it may be extended forward towards the viewer
                  slightly, with the foot on tiptoe. Three similar figures stand to Christian’s
                  right, one in front of the other two. The frontmost figure wears a long, loose,
                  semi-transparent gown, and slightly pronounced breasts suggest that she is female.
                  She faces the viewer, with her head turned slightly to her left, looking at
                  Christian. Her long, curly hair falls behind her neck and shoulders. A few strands
                  of hair on her right side stand on end and resemble flames. She has a halo
                  surrounding her head. Her arms are both close to her sides, but bent upward at the
                  elbow so that forearms and hands are raised. Both hands are raised, with palms
                  facing out towards the viewer and fingers spread. Although she faces forward, she
                  is clearly midstride as her left leg is extended backward and bent at the knee,
                  with the foot on tiptoe. From the viewing angle, her right leg appears to be
                  straight, but it may be extended forward towards the viewer slightly. The right
                  foot is not clearly visible. The two figures behind this one are mostly obscured
                  by her body. The right figure—between Christian and the frontmost woman—is of an
                  indeterminate sex, although the long hair and gown suggest that she is possibly
                  female. She(?) has her head bent back, eyes raised looking up either at
                  Christian’s face or to the sky above them. She wears a long, loose gown and has
                  long, curly hair which falls behind her neck and shoulders. A halo surrounds her
                  head, with two prominent beams of light extending out from it. The figure’s right
                  arm is raised vertically, fully extended, and holds an indeterminate object in her
                  hand. Her left arm is down at her side, reaching down fully extended, and holding
                  a large, flat, indeterminate object, possibly a book, between the forearm and
                  torso. Only her left leg is visible, and it stands straight, with the foot on
                  tiptoe. The leftmost figure is also of indeterminate sex, although the long gown
                  suggests she is possibly female. She(?) wears a long, loose gown. Her hair is
                  short and straight, framing the face. Her head is bent slightly to her left, with
                  eyes raised, possibly looking at Christian’s face or to the sky above them. A halo
                  surrounds her head. Both of the figure’s arms are raised vertically, fully
                  extended with hands raised, palms up. Her legs are hard to distinguish, but it
                  appears that they are crossed with the left leg in front and possibly extending
                  forward slightly, indicating that the figure is midstride. All of the figures walk
                  on a flat, grassy stretch of ground at the bottom of the image, with clear patches
                  of grass and leaves spread across it. A short indeterminate bush or shrub is
                  partly visible at the right edge of the image. It has thin, pointed, flame-like
                  leaves, and is possibly a laurel. Another indeterminate leafy plant is faintly
                  visible on the right edge, just above the rightmost figure’s left hand. It appears
                  to have a few berries on it. A final indeterminate and faintly drawn plant is
                  visible to the right of Christian’s left knee, with a few pointed leaves. A large
                  hill rises behind the figures, filling the upper portions of the image. A large
                  castle-like building sits atop the hill. It is faintly drawn, but has there is a
                  clear large door or gate in the center of the building, with a triangular top.
                  Large, square walls flank either side of the gate, topped with four tall, thin
                  spires extending from these walls, two on either side of the gate. A second set of
                  walls can be seen behind the first, extending farther on either side. The right
                  wall of this set has another spire at its end. Roughly sketched lines to the left
                  of the gate possibly indicate a human figure, standing and facing forward, perhaps
                  the porter Watchful.</illusobjdesc>

                     gown suggest that she is possibly female. She(?) has her head bent back, eyes
                     raised looking up either at Christian’s face or to the sky above them. She
                     wears a long, loose gown and has long, curly hair which falls behind her neck
                     and shoulders. A halo surrounds her head, with two prominent beams of light
                     extending out from it. The figure’s right arm is raised vertically, fully
                     extended, and holds an indeterminate object in her hand. Her left arm is down
                     at her side, reaching down fully extended, and holding a large, flat,
                     indeterminate object, possibly a book, between the forearm and torso. Only her
                     left leg is visible, and it stands straight, with the foot on
                     tiptoe.</illusobjdesc>

                     She(?) wears a long, loose gown. Her hair is short and straight, framing the

                     at Christian’s face or to the sky above them. A halo surrounds her head. Both
                     of the figure’s arms are raised vertically, fully extended with hands raised,
                     palms up. Her legs are hard to distinguish, but it appears that they are
                     crossed with the left leg in front and possibly extending forward slightly,

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>Christian fights the demon Apollyon. Apollyon dominates the image,
                  standing over Christian, facing forward with arms and legs spread, forming a
                  massive X across the image. He skin is either covered in scales or he wears
                  skintight chainmail over his entire body. His arms are both raised at 135 degrees.
                  He holds single short spear in his left hand, and two in his right, all with
                  large, pointed spearheads aimed at Christian below him. His head leans forward and
                  down from his shoulders, and his eyes are down looking at Christian. He has a halo
                  around his head, with several dark beams of light extending out from the halo. The
                  top of his head itself is covered in short spikes, perhaps a helmet or crown, or
                  perhaps his hair standing on end. His eyes are large and fully open. He has a long
                  and wide nose, with a curled mustache underneath. His mouth is open, and three
                  jagged bolts of lightning emit from his mouth. His chest is broad and muscular.
                  His legs are spread wide, one on either side of Christian, with large feet with
                  prominent toes and visible short claws on his right toes. He has large, dark,
                  batlike wings spreading out behind him. His body is cloaked in dark flames, which
                  rise above his head, and extend outward on either side of his torso and down over
                  his left leg. Christian kneels below Apollyon, clearly beaten down by his
                  opponent. He wears armor, most clearly evidenced by the greaves on his legs and
                  the seams between plates of armor on his shoulders, wrists, and knees. His lower
                  body is seen in profile, facing left with his left leg visible to the viewer,
                  while his upper body is twisted to face away from the viewer, making his back
                  visible. The left leg is folded completely, with knee on the ground, foot standing
                  on tiptoe, and thigh bent on top of the calf, so that Christian sits on his left
                  heel. His left arm is raised, but mostly hidden behind his circular shield, the
                  Shield of Faith, with which Christian blocks some of Apollyon’s lightning bolts.
                  His right arm is fully extended, reaching downward to grab his weapon from the
                  ground. The weapon appears to be a sword, with a pommel at the end of a hilt, but
                  there is no crossguard, or if there is, Christian’s hand blocks it from view, so
                  it may be a staff or walking stick. It lies on the ground just below Christian’s
                  right hand, with Apollyon’s left foot standing over it. Christian’s head is turned
                  to the right and bent back, with his eyes raised looking up at Apollyon. He wears
                  a helmet, cowl, or similar headpiece which wraps around his head and covers his
                  neck. A few locks of long, curly hair can be seen flowing out from underneath the
                  headpiece. His mouth is slightly open, in an expression of surprise or fear. An
                  indeterminate object just behind and to the left of Christian is possibly his
                  right leg, bent upward with the knee in the air, but it may also be a tall stone
                  standing in the background. Christian and Apollyon stand on an expanse of flat
                  ground covered in a bloody substance, particularly around Apollyon’s right foot,
                  under Christian’s left leg, and around and on Christian’s weapon. The sky behind
                  Apollyon’s left leg in the background is dark, and upper portions of the sky are
                  fiery, indicating possibly a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>Christian fights the demon Apollyon. Christian kneels below
                     Apollyon, clearly beaten down by his opponent. He wears armor, most clearly
                     evidenced by the greaves on his legs and the seams between plates of armor on
                     his shoulders, wrists, and knees. His lower body is seen in profile, facing
                     left with his left leg visible to the viewer, while his upper body is twisted
                     to face away from the viewer, making his back visible. The left leg is folded
                     completely, with knee on the ground, foot standing on tiptoe, and thigh bent on
                     top of the calf, so that Christian sits on his left heel. His left arm is
                     raised, but mostly hidden behind his circular shield, the Shield of Faith, with
                     which Christian blocks some of Apollyon’s lightning bolts. His right arm is
                     fully extended, reaching downward to grab his weapon from the ground. The
                     weapon appears to be a sword, with a pommel at the end of a hilt, but there is
                     no crossguard, or if there is, Christian’s hand blocks it from view, so it may
                     be a staff or walking stick. It lies on the ground just below Christian’s right
                     hand, with Apollyon’s left foot standing over it. Christian’s head is turned to
                     the right and bent back, with his eyes raised looking up at Apollyon. He wears
                     a helmet, cowl, or similar headpiece which wraps around his head and covers his
                     neck. A few locks of long, curly hair can be seen flowing out from underneath
                     the headpiece. His mouth is slightly open, in an expression of surprise or
                     fear. An indeterminate object just behind and to the left of Christian is
                     possibly his right leg, bent upward with the knee in the air, but it may also
                     be a tall stone standing in the background.</illusobjdesc>

                  of the trees along the left and right margins. Butlin also quotes the following

               <illusobjdesc>Christian walks with Faithful, who tells his story. The two figures
                  stand in the middle of the image, facing forward; they are midstride, with
                  Faithful on the left and Christian on the right. Christian wears a long, loose
                  cloak or cape, which is transparent to the point that his body is fully visible
                  underneath. The cloak parts at his chest, falling down on either side of his lower
                  body, with its lower hem visible behind and to the right of his left leg. He
                  appears to be wearing other garments underneath, as indicated by a waistline
                  marking the top hem of his pants. Either the cloak or the shirt underneath is
                  long-sleeved, as indicated by lines marking cuffs at his wrists. His head is
                  turned and tilted slightly to his right, looking towards Faithful, and he wears a
                  helmet, cowl, or some other headpiece covering the top of his head and wrapping
                  around the sides of his face and under his chin. His long, curly hair flows out
                  from underneath this headpiece and falls behind his neck and shoulders. Both arms
                  are close to his sides, with his right arm fully extended reaching downward. His
                  right hand is turned to face the viewer palm out, with his thumb clearly spread
                  separate from the other fingers. His left arm is also close to his side, but bent
                  upward at the elbow so that the forearm and hand are raised. The hand is barely
                  visible, but it appears to be open with palm facing out towards the viewer and
                  fingers spread. Although he faces forward, he is clearly midstride as his left leg
                  is extended backward and bent at the knee, with the foot on tiptoe. From the
                  viewing angle, his right leg appears to be straight, but it may be extended
                  forward towards the viewer slightly, with the foot planted on the ground, possibly
                  on its toes. The legs are not spread in a wide stride and are relatively close
                  together. Faithful wears a long, loose, long-sleeved gown with covers all of his
                  body but his head and hands. His head is turned and tilted slightly to his left,
                  looking towards Christian, and he is possibly wearing a hood or some other head
                  covering, although it appears looser than Christian’s. Long, possibly curly hair
                  flows out from under the hood and behind his neck and shoulders. He appears to
                  have a beard. His left arm is held away from his side and bent upward at the elbow
                  so that the forearm and hand are raised. The hand is faintly drawn, but appears to
                  be turned with the palm to the right, and his pointer finger raised up, towards
                  the vignette above his head. One or more other fingers may also be spread. His
                  left arm is close to his side and fully extended reaching downward. His right hand
                  holds his right thigh. Although his gown covers his legs and he faces forward, he
                  appears to be midstride with the right leg extended forward, as evidenced by a
                  bulge in his cloak along his right thigh and knee. Two vignettes fill the space
                  above Faithful and Christian, presumably events from Faithful’s story of his
                  journey. Both vignettes are contained in circular spaces, and both depict pairs of
                  figures in struggles. The left vignette shows two figures more or less
                  side-by-side. The left figure in the vignette is Faithful. He faces left and is
                  seen in profile, although the figure’s torso appears to be twisted so that the
                  upper-back is seen from behind. Both arms are raised vertically above the figure’s
                  head, fully extended. His head appears to be turned to the right so that he looks
                  over his right shoulder to the other figure in the vignette. His left leg is fully
                  extended backward, and his right leg is extended forward and bent at the knee,
                  indicating the he is midstride in a fleeing or running motion. The right figure,
                  the "old Man" (also called "Adam the first") in the vignette faces forward towards
                  the viewer. Its head appears to be turned slightly to the its right, looking at
                  the left figure. It has a broad-shouldered and muscular body. Its right arm is
                  raised at 45 degrees, reaching for the left figure, and perhaps pushing him. The
                  left arm is close to the figure’s side. The figure’s legs are spread wide, with
                  the right leg fully extended towards the right, although the calf and foot are
                  hidden behind the left figure. The left leg is out to the left, but bent at the
                  knee so that the lower leg is vertical. Lines in the figure’s groin possibly
                  indicate male genitals or a loincloth. The right vignette also depicts two figures
                  in a struggle, with one standing over the other. The lower figure in the vignette
                  is Faithful. He lies almost horizontal along the bottom of the scene, seen mostly
                  in profile facing right. His head is bent down. His left arm is raised vertically,
                  fully extended. His right arm is raised horizontally, but bent at the elbow with
                  the forearm folding back towards his head. His hand is possibly bent upwards at
                  the wrist and raised, palm up. His body is folded at the waist—where the upper
                  figure’s foot is planted—and his legs are together, but both bent at the knees and
                  drawn up slightly, as if in an expanded fetal position. There is some uncertainty
                  in the passage illustrated about who the other figure in the vignette is, but he
                  is finally identified as Moses. He stands over slightly right of Faithful. He
                  faces forward towards the viewer. His head appears to be bent down slightly,
                  looking at the other figure. Both arms are raised vertically above its head, with
                  his left arm fully extended and his right bent slightly at the elbow. He appears
                  to hold an indeterminate object in his right hand. He has a broad-shouldered and
                  muscular body. His legs are spread wide as if midstride or lunging. His right leg
                  is extended forward but bent at the knee so that the lower leg is vertical, and he
                  steps on Faithful. His left leg is extended backwards and possibly also bent at
                  the knee. Christian and Faithful walk on a path or road in the lower-middle
                  section of the image, and extending behind them. Grassy hills rise in successive
                  layers on either side of Christian and Faithful. Two barren, leafless trees rise
                  along the left and right margins of the image, framing the scene. Each tree has a
                  small, short branch at about Christian and Faithful’s head-level, reaching towards
                  the vignettes. At least two buildings stand in the background on the right side of
                  the image. The closer one is square, with an arched doorway leading into a dark
                  interior. The second building is behind the first, apparently on a hill above it.
                  This building has a rectangular bottom layer. The upper layer consists of three
                  thin, rectangular, vertical towers on the left, and a dome on the right. Both
                  buildings are partially obscured by the right tree.</illusobjdesc>

                     cloak or cape, which is transparent to the point that his body is fully visible
                     underneath. The cloak parts at his chest, falling down on either side of his
                     lower body, with its lower hem visible behind and to the right of his left leg.
                     He appears to be wearing other garments underneath, as indicated by a waistline
                     marking the top hem of his pants. Either the cloak or the shirt underneath is

                     shoulders. Both arms are close to his sides, with his right arm fully extended
                     reaching downward. His right hand is turned to face the viewer palm out, with
                     his thumb clearly spread separate from the other fingers. His left arm is also

                     are raised. The hand is barely visible, but it appears to be open with palm
                     facing out towards the viewer and fingers spread. Although he faces forward, he
                     is clearly midstride as his left leg is extended backward and bent at the knee,
                     with the foot on tiptoe. From the viewing angle, his right leg appears to be
                     straight, but it may be extended forward towards the viewer slightly, with the
                     foot planted on the ground, possibly on its toes. The legs are not spread in a
                     wide stride and are relatively close together.</illusobjdesc>

                     Faithful on the left and Christian on the right. Faithful wears a long, loose,
                     long-sleeved gown with covers all of his body but his head and hands. His head
                     is turned and tilted slightly to his left looking towards Christian, and he is
                     possibly wearing a hood or some other head covering, although it appears looser
                     than Christian’s. Long, possibly curly hair flows out from under the hood and
                     behind his neck and shoulders. He appears to have a beard. His left arm is held
                     away from his side and bent upward at the elbow so that the forearm and hand
                     are raised. The hand is faintly drawn, but appears to be turned with the palm
                     to the right, and his pointer finger raised up, towards the vignette above his
                     head. One or more other fingers may also be spread. His left arm is close to
                     his side and fully extended reaching downward. His right hand holds his right
                     thigh. Although his gown covers his legs and he faces forward, he appears to be
                     midstride with the left leg bent at the knee and extended backward, as
                     evidenced by a bulge in his cloak along his left thigh and knee.</illusobjdesc>

                     figure’s torso appears to be twisted so that the upper-back is seen from
                     behind. Both arms are raised vertically above the figure’s head, fully
                     extended. His head appears to be turned to the right so that he looks over his
                     right shoulder to the other figure in the vignette. His left leg is fully
                     extended backward, and his right leg is extended forward and bent at the knee,
                     indicating the he is midstride in a fleeing or running motion.</illusobjdesc>

                     The left vignette shows two figures more or less side-by-side. The right figure
                     in the vignette faces forward towards the viewer. He is the "old Man," also
                     called "Adam the first." His head appears to be turned slightly to the his
                     right, looking at the left figure. He has a broad-shouldered and muscular body.
                     His right arm is raised at 45 degrees, reaching for the left figure, and
                     perhaps pushing him. The left arm is close to the figure’s side. The figure’s
                     legs are spread wide, with the right leg fully extended towards the right,
                     although the calf and foot are hidden behind the left figure. The left leg is
                     out to the left, but bent at the knee so that the lower leg is vertical. Lines
                     in the figure’s groin possibly indicate male genitals or a
                     loincloth.</illusobjdesc>

                     bent at the elbow with the forearm folding back towards his head. His hand is
                     possibly bent upwards at the wrist and raised, palm up. His body is folded at
                     the waist—where the upper figure’s foot is planted—and his legs are together,
                     but both bent at the knees and drawn up slightly, as if in an expanded fetal

                     with one standing over the other in the right vignette. There is some

                     vignette is, but he is finally identified as Moses. He stands over and slightly
                     right of Faithful. He faces forward towards the viewer. His head appears to be
                     bent down slightly, looking at the other figure. Both arms are raised
                     vertically above its head, with his left arm fully extended and his right bent
                     slightly at the elbow. He appears to hold an indeterminate object in his right
                     hand. He has a broad-shouldered and muscular body. His legs are spread wide as
                     if midstride or lunging. His right leg is extended forward but bent at the knee
                     so that the lower leg is vertical, and he steps on Faithful. His left leg is

            <illustration type="plate" location="E">
               <illusobjdesc>Christian and Faithful are imprisoned in Vanity Fair. Much of the image
                  is in an incomplete sketch form, except for two male dancers in the center of the
                  image. The right dancer stands facing forward towards the viewer. His upper arms
                  are both raised at 135 degrees, but they are bent at the elbow so that the
                  forearms are raised almost vertically above his head. Both hands have the pointer
                  fingers extended, pointing towards Christian and Faithful in the background, and
                  the other fingers folded in towards the palms. His head is turned in profile and
                  bent back with his eyes raised so that he looks up towards Christian and Faithful.
                  He has short hair smoothed down towards the back of his head. He wears a
                  skintight, long-sleeved, single-piece garment that covers his entire body except
                  for his hands, neck, and head, revealing a muscular physique underneath. The parts
                  of the garment covering the torso and legs are covered in a diamond checkered
                  pattern. The diamonds are checkered red and white the chest, right leg, and lower
                  left legs, and blue and white on the hips, thighs, and upper left leg, with a few
                  blue diamonds on the upper right leg. The garment's feet are without a pattern.
                  The sleeves are plain and separated from the rest of the garment by seams around
                  the shoulders and armpits, and colored green. His torso is twisted in a serpentine
                  stance, so that his right hip is struck out to the side. his right leg is fully
                  extended, standing on tiptoe. His left leg is bent at the knee so that the lower
                  leg is raised and extended backward. The foot is bent sharply down at the ankle,
                  standing on tiptoe on the ground behind his right leg. The left dancer stands
                  facing away from the viewer, with legs and arms spread in an X shape. His arms are
                  both raised vertically above his head and fully extended. His left hand is raised
                  open and bent so that the palm faces up, and his fingers appear to be spread. The
                  right hand is also raised with fingers spread, but with palm facing out away from
                  the viewer. His head is turned in profile and bent back to the point that it is
                  perpendicular to his neck, with his eyes raised so that he looks up towards
                  Christian and Faithful. His mouth is open. His hair is short and smoothed back
                  over his head, except for a row of tight curls at his hairline. He wears a
                  skintight, long-sleeved, single-piece garment that covers his entire body except
                  for his hands, neck, and head, revealing a muscular physique underneath. The
                  garment is patterned into four quarters, with the left arm and torso as one white
                  quarter, the right arm and torso as a black quarter, the left leg as another black
                  quarter, and the right leg as the other white quarter. Both legs are spread and
                  straight, standing on tiptoe. The other six figures in the image are unfinished
                  sketches, with two on each edge of the image, and Christian and Faithful at the
                  top. The lower-left figure is female, based on her long hair and pronounced
                  breasts. She stands in profile, facing right, but with her head turned to her
                  right looking at the dancers so that her face is fully visible. She has long,
                  curly hair which flows down her neck and shoulders. She wears a long, loose gown
                  which covers all of her body but her head and hands. Her right arm is raised at
                  135 degrees, although it is partially blocked by the left dancer’s left arm. The
                  hand appears to be pointing towards Christian and Faithful. The upper portion of
                  her left arm is hidden behind her body, but the forearm is visible, bent upward at
                  the elbow and raised. In her left hand she holds a mask, much like one of the
                  ancient Greek theatre masks associated with comedy and tragedy. The mask has wide
                  eyes, a widely-opened mouth, and two small circular objects attached to the top.
                  The figure’s buttocks are pronounced, and her right leg is straight, with the foot
                  flat on the floor. Her left leg is hidden behind her right and not visible. A
                  figure stands behind her, but is very loosely sketched. Much of his body is hidden
                  behind the front figure, except his head, chest, and an arm. He wears a tall,
                  conical hat, resembling a bishop’s mitre, and thus he is likely male. He appears
                  to be wearing a loose gown or robe. One of his arms might be raised at 135
                  degrees, gesturing towards Christian and Faithful. The lower-right figure stands
                  facing forward towards the viewer. Her sex is not clear, but she is likely female
                  to match her counterpart on the left. Her head is tilted slightly to her left, and
                  she has short, curly hair in tight curls around her face. She wears a long, loose
                  gown which covers all of her body but her head and hands. Both arms are down close
                  to her sides, but bent upward at the elbows so that forearms are raised. Her right
                  forearm is raised out to the side, with the hand raised, palm out towards the
                  viewer, and fingers spread. Her left forearm is also raised towards her right,
                  crossing over her torso. In her left hand she holds a mask, similar to her
                  partner’s, although less clearly detailed. Like her partner’s, the mask is similar
                  to ancient Greek theatre masks associated with comedy and tragedy. The mask’s
                  mouth is possibly slightly open. She stands with her legs straight and together,
                  but crossed, with the right leg in front. A figure stands behind her, but is very
                  loosely sketched. Much of its body is hidden behind the front figure, except its
                  head, chest, and an arm. Its sex is not clear, though it is likely male to match
                  its counterpart on the left. He wears a three-pronged crown or other headpiece. He
                  raises one arm, likely his right arm, at 135 degrees, gesturing towards Christian
                  and Faithful with his hand, which is bent at the wrist so that it is flat parallel
                  with the ground. All four of these bottom figures stand on an expanse of flat
                  ground. Behind the four lower figures, a massive structure stands, filling most of
                  the background. The structure has three domes, one large one in the back-center,
                  and two smaller on either side of and in front of the central dome. The two side
                  domes are topped with thin, short spires or spikes, which are then topped with
                  small circular objects just below their tips. A two-stepped dais or platform is
                  situated between the two smaller domes. A tall, vertical pole stands in the middle
                  of this dais, topped with a cross, although it is possible that this shaft is a
                  spire topping the central dome. Christian and Faithful stand on this dais, one on
                  either side of the pole. They are loosely drawn, so it is difficult to tell which
                  is which. The left figure stands mostly facing forward, but turned slightly to his
                  left, facing the viewer's right. His head is straight, and he appears to be
                  looking at the other figure to the right. He appears to have curly hair. He wears
                  a long, loose gown with a belt at his waist. Only his right arm is visible, and it
                  is fully extended down at his side. A length of chain extends from the dais,
                  connected to his belt, with another shorter length connected to his right wrist.
                  He may have a shackle around this wrist and his ankles. The right figure stands in
                  a similar position, although at more of an angle facing his right, the viewer's
                  left. He also wears a long, loose gown. His head is straight and looks at the
                  other prisoner. He has clearly curly hair. Only his left arm is visible, and it is
                  wrapped around his torso, as if hugging himself. A length of chain extends from
                  the dais towards his waist. He is also possibly shackled at his
                  ankles.</illusobjdesc>

                     male dancers in the center of the image. The right dancer stands facing forward
                     towards the viewer. His upper arms are both raised at 135 degrees, but they are
                     bent at the elbow so that the forearms are raised almost vertically above his
                     head. Both hands have the pointer fingers extended, pointing towards Christian
                     and Faithful in the background, and the other fingers folded in towards the
                     palms. His head is turned in profile and bent back with his eyes raised so that
                     he looks up towards Christian and Faithful. He has short hair smoothed down
                     towards the back of his head. He wears a skintight, long-sleeved, single-piece
                     garment that covers his entire body except for his hands, neck, and head,
                     revealing a muscular physique underneath. The parts of the garment covering the
                     torso and legs are covered in a diamond checkered pattern. The diamonds are
                     checkered red and white the chest, right leg, and lower left legs, and blue and
                     white on the hips, thighs, and upper left leg, with a few blue diamonds on the
                     upper right leg. The garment's feet are without a pattern. The sleeves are
                     plain and separated from the rest of the garment by seams around the shoulders
                     and armpits, and colored green. His torso is twisted in a serpentine stance, so
                     that his right hip is struck out to the side. His right leg is straight,
                     standing on tiptoe. His left leg is bent at the knee so that the lower leg is
                     raised and extended backward. The foot is bent sharply down at the ankle,
                     standing on tiptoe on the ground behind his right leg.</illusobjdesc>

                     raised vertically above his head and fully extended. His left hand is raised
                     open and bent so that the palm faces up, and his fingers appear to be spread.
                     The right hand is also raised with fingers spread, but with palm facing out
                     away from the viewer. His head is turned in profile and bent back to the point
                     that it is perpendicular to his neck, with his eyes raised so that he looks up
                     towards Christian and Faithful. His mouth is open. His hair is short and
                     smoothed back over his head, except for a row of tight curls at his hairline.
                     He wears a skintight, long-sleeved, single-piece garment that covers his entire

                     left leg as another black quarter, and the right leg as the other white

                     Faithful at the top. The lower-left figure is female, based on her long hair
                     and pronounced breasts. She stands in profile, facing right, but with her head
                     turned to her right looking at the dancers so that her face is fully visible.
                     She has long, curly hair which flows down her neck and shoulders. She wears a
                     long, loose gown which covers all of her body but her head and hands. Her right
                     arm is raised at 135 degrees, although it is partially blocked by the left
                     dancer’s left arm. The hand appears to be pointing towards Christian and
                     Faithful. The upper portion of her left arm is hidden behind her body, but the
                     forearm is visible, bent upward at the elbow and raised. In her left hand she

                     its body is hidden behind the front figure, except its head, chest, and an arm.
                     Its sex is not clear, though it is likely male to match its counterpart on the
                     left. He wears a three-pronged crown or other headpiece. He raises one arm,
                     likely his right arm, at 135 degrees, gesturing towards Christian and Faithful
                     with his hand, which is bent at the wrist so that it is flat parallel with the
                     ground.</illusobjdesc>

                     Behind the four lower figures, a massive structure stands, filling most of the
                     background. The structure has three domes, one large one in the back-center,
                     and two smaller on either side of and in front of the central dome. The two
                     side domes are topped with thin, short spires or spikes, which are then topped
                     with small circular objects just below their tips. A two-stepped dais or
                     platform is situated between the two smaller domes. A tall, vertical pole
                     stands in the middle of this dais, topped with a cross, although it is possible
                     that this shaft is a spire topping the central dome. Christian and Faithful

                     left, facing the viewer's right. His head is straight, and he appears to be
                     looking at the other figure to the right. He appears to have curly hair. He

               <illusobjdesc>Faithful is martyred at Vanity Fair while Christian and other figures
                  watch. A male figure, possibly Christian, stands facing away from the viewer in
                  the lower-middle portion of the image. He wears a long-sleeved, loose,
                  semi-transparent gown. His shoulders, buttocks, thighs, and calves are visible
                  through the gown. His arms are raised at 135 degrees and fully extended. His hands
                  are raised with palms facing up and away from the viewer and fingers spread. His
                  head is turned to the left so the viewer can see the face in profile. His head is
                  bent back and his eyes are raised so he looks up to the spirit of Faithful in the
                  sky above him. His hair is faintly visible, but appears to be long and curly,
                  flowing down his neck and between his shoulder blades. His mouth is slightly open.
                  He stands with his legs together. The left leg is straight, with foot flat on the
                  ground. His right leg is bent at the knee, and the leg may be extended backward
                  slightly, although it is difficult to tell from the viewing angle. The right foot
                  stands on tiptoe. The right foot stands on tiptoe. Another male figure kneels to
                  the left of the center figure, and he may be Hopeful. He faces right and is mostly
                  viewed in profile, but his body is twisted so that most of his upper chest faces
                  the viewer. His arms are both fully extended, with the right arm raised vertically
                  and the left raised at 135 degrees. Both hands are raised, with both palms up and
                  out towards the viewer, and fingers spread. His head is seen in profile facing
                  right and bent back with his eyes raised so that he looks up and to the right
                  towards Christian. He has short, curly hair. Only his right leg is visible, and it
                  is bent at the knee with the lower leg on the ground. The left leg is hidden
                  behind the right, but the left foot is visible extending behind the right foot.
                  Three clear figures lie on their sides in the lower-right corner of the image,
                  with two possible figures faintly drawn above them along the right edge. The
                  bottom-most figure lies on its side, facing the viewer, but with its upper body
                  raised and supported by its arms. The figure is faintly drawn and of indeterminate
                  sex. It wears a loose, flowing, long-sleeved gown. Its head is turned in profile,
                  facing left, and bent back with eyes raised so that it looks up and to the left
                  towards Christian and Faithful. The figure appears to be wearing a tight-fitting
                  hat around its head, resembling a skullcap, with a thick fringe around the bottom
                  of the cap. Its mouth may be slightly open. Only its right arm is clear, and it
                  crosses over the figure's torso, reaching down to the ground and fully extended,
                  holding its body up. The middle figure of the lower three lies above the lowest
                  figure, but partially hidden behind it. It faces forward towards the viewer, but
                  with its head turned slightly to its right. The figure has distinct facial
                  features, but the sex is not immediately clear, although it appears bald and is
                  therefore likely male. He appears to be lying on its side with his upper body
                  raised, possibly supported by his arms, although they are hidden behind the lowest
                  figure. His face is the only part of this figure that is drawn in any detail, with
                  a large nose, wide eyes which look down and to the left towards Christian and the
                  kneeling figure, a slightly open mouth, and furrowed brows which convey an
                  expression of fear or melancholy. The third figure of the lower three lies above
                  the middle figure, but partially hidden behind it. The figure has very little
                  details drawn, and sex is therefore indeterminate. It appears to be facing away
                  from the viewer, lying with its lower body along the ground (although hidden
                  behind the other figures and Christian), and its upper body raised, so perhaps in
                  the middle of a falling movement. Its arms are both raised vertically, although
                  the left arm is bent at the elbow so that the forearm bends to the right, over the
                  figure’s head. Both hands are raised vertically, with palms to the left and
                  fingers spread. Two more figures possibly stand side-by-side along the right edge
                  above and behind the three on the ground, but they consist solely of two circles
                  with may be heads. In the midground on the left side of the image, Faithful’s
                  corpse stands on fire. He stands facing the viewer, with his body positioned
                  indicating death: head down on his chest, arms crossed and folded over his chest,
                  and legs together, although the legs are largely obscured by the flames which
                  engulf him. The body is gaunt, without hair or a face, burned beyond recognition.
                  The body is surrounded by dark, straight, vertical flames, which resemble spikes
                  or spires. A few of these flames extend towards the center of the image, behind
                  the kneeling figure, with a couple further to the right under Christian’s right
                  arm. The top half of the image is dominated by the spirit of Faithful carried
                  upward by two horses. The spirit of Faithful is shown in profile, flying
                  diagonally up and to the right from his corpse, facing right. He appears as an old
                  man, with long hair flowing down behind his shoulders onto his back. He also has a
                  short beard. His head is bent back slightly, with his eyes raised looking up to
                  the sky. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved, and semi-transparent gown. Only his
                  right arm is fully visible, and it is down at his side, but bent upward at the
                  elbow so that the forearm is raised. His hand is held in a posture indicating
                  prayer. Only his right leg is fully visible through the gown as the left is hidden
                  behind it, but his legs are together, straight, and fully extended slightly
                  backwards, towards his corpse. The two horses fly to the right of him, also in a
                  diagonal position from lower-left to upper-right, and facing right. They are seen
                  in profile and positioned one behind the other. Only one of the horses is fully
                  visible, the one closer to the viewer. This horse has its head pulled back, eyes
                  wide, and mouth open, with its tongue out and forward. His front legs are fully
                  extended in front of his body, and his hind legs are also fully extended behind
                  his body, as if in mid-gallop. The lower portions of the hind legs, including the
                  hooves, are obscured by Christian. Flame-like shapes of extend back from the
                  horse’s neck, and are possibly locks of hair from its mane, or flames from the
                  fire that surrounds the horses and Faithful. The second horse is largely obscured
                  by the first, with only its head visible above the others, with a similar
                  wide-eyed and open-mouthed expression. More serpentine, billowing flames extend
                  diagonally up to the right, surrounding the spirit of Faithful and the horses
                  which carry him upward. A large dome is visible in the background behind the
                  burning corpse of Faithful, topped with a cross, resembling the dome of St. Paul’s
                  Cathedral.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>Faithful is martyred at Vanity Fair while Christian and other
                     figures watch. A male figure, possibly Christian, stands facing away from the
                     viewer in the lower-middle portion of the image. He wears a long-sleeved,
                     loose, semi-transparent gown. His shoulders, buttocks, thighs, and calves are
                     visible through the gown. His arms are raised at 135 degrees and fully
                     extended. His hands are raised with palms facing up and away from the viewer
                     and fingers spread. His head is turned to the left so the viewer can see the
                     face in profile. His head is bent back and his eyes are raised so he looks up
                     to the spirit of Faithful in the sky above him. His hair is faintly visible,

                     fully extended, with the right arm raised vertically and the left raised at 135
                     degrees. Both hands are raised, with both palms up and out towards the viewer,

                     his eyes raised so that he looks up and to the right towards Christian. He has
                     short, curly hair. Only his right leg is visible, and it is bent at the knee
                     with the lower leg on the ground. The left leg is hidden behind the right, but

                     drawn and of indeterminate sex. It wears a loose, flowing, long-sleeved gown.
                     Its head is turned in profile, facing left, and bent back with eyes raised so
                     that it looks up and to the left towards Christian and Faithful. The figure
                     appears to be wearing a tight-fitting hat around its head, resembling a

                     slightly open. Only its right arm is clear, and it crosses over the figure's

                     a falling movement. Its arms are both raised vertically, although the left arm
                     is bent at the elbow so that the forearm bends to the right, over the figure’s

               <illusobjdesc>Christian and Hopeful are imprisoned in Doubting Castle, and taunted by
                  the giant Despair. The image is dominated by Despair, who is massive in comparison
                  to the other two figures in the image. He stands facing away from the viewer, with
                  his legs straight, but his upper body bent slightly down to his right. He is
                  entirely naked, and very muscular. His left arm is raised at 135 degrees, with a
                  slight bend upward at the elbow. His left hand is raised, with the palm out away
                  from the viewer and fingers spread. His right arm is raised horizontally. His hand
                  is closed, holding two keys which dangle on an unseen chain or keyring. Both arms
                  are fully extended. His head is turned to his right and slightly down, and it is
                  seen in profile. He has short, curly hair. His eyes are down, looking at Christian
                  and Hopeful below him and to his right. He may be frowning. His legs are together,
                  and he has thick, short, curly hair on his buttocks and thighs. The left leg is
                  straight with the foot flat on the floor. The right leg is bent slightly at the
                  knee and the foot stands on tiptoe. The leg is possibly extended slightly behind
                  him, though it is difficult to tell from the viewing angle. The other two figures,
                  Christian and Hopeful, sit on the ground in the lower-right portion of the image.
                  Although they are fairly detailed, they are not detailed enough to differentiate
                  one from the other. The left figure sits on the floor of the cell facing forward.
                  His right leg is folded underneath him, with the knee on the ground. His left leg
                  is drawn up into his body and bent at the knee, with the foot flat on the ground
                  and knee raised. His left arm is at his side, but raised slightly so it rests on
                  his left knee. It is bent upward at the elbow, and the hand holds his head, which
                  is tilted slightly to his left to rest in the hand. He has curly hair. His eyes
                  appear to be down, and this expression—along with his positioning of head in his
                  hand—suggest melancholy or despair. His right arm is not clearly visible, and is
                  possibly behind his back. The right figure also sits facing forward, but with both
                  legs drawn up into his body and crossed at the ankles, feet flat on the ground and
                  knees raised. The legs obscure most of his body from view. His arms are both down
                  at his sides, but bent upward at the elbow, with his hands resting on his knees.
                  His head is deeply folded down into his chest so that his face is not visible at
                  all, and he rests his head on top of his hands, in a clear position of melancholy
                  or despair. The three figures are all inside a large, dark room, likely a prison
                  cell or dungeon. The walls are made of large, dark blocks of stone. A row of
                  particularly dark blocks at the top of the wall above Christian and Hopeful are
                  possibly windows, revealing a dark night sky. An indeterminate object appears to
                  be built into the wall above and to the right of the sitting figures. It has a
                  circular ring at its top, with a short, vertical shaft or rod extending straight
                  down from the ring towards the ground. It is possibly a metal ring for attaching
                  chains and/or shackles. The floor of the cell below the two sitting figures is
                  darker than that under Despair, perhaps indicating shadows or a pool of dark water
                  or some other substance.</illusobjdesc>

               <illusobjdesc>Christian and Hopeful are shown fleeing from Doubting Castle, with
                  Despair following behind. Christian and Hopeful both stand midstride running away
                  from the castle in the bottom-left corner of the image. Although they are fairly
                  detailed, they are not detailed enough to differentiate one from the other. One
                  stands slightly in front of the other from the viewer’s perspective, obscuring
                  parts of the back figure’s body. The front figure faces left and runs in profile,
                  but with his head and upper body turned slightly away from the viewer, towards the
                  back figure. Only the back of his head can be seen, and he appears to have short
                  hair. He wears a long, semi-transparent, long-sleeved gown. His left arm is
                  extended in front of his body, and raised at 45 degrees. His hand is raised, with
                  the palm vertical and facing left. His right arm is extended slightly behind his
                  body, and also raised at 45 degrees. The hand of this arm is held parallel to the
                  ground, with the palm down. His entire upper body is bent forward at about 45
                  degrees, leaning into his run. His right leg is extended forward slightly, bent at
                  the knee, with the foot flat on the ground. A short shadow falls behind the right
                  foot. His left leg is extended backward, bent slightly at the knee, with the foot
                  raised off the ground. The back figure stands slightly to the left of the front
                  figure, and he faces forward towards the reader. He wears a long,
                  semi-transparent, long-sleeved gown. His arms are both fully extended and raised,
                  one vertically, the other at 135 degrees. The hands of both arms are raised, with
                  palms facing forward towards the viewer, and fingers spread. He may be wearing a
                  hood over his head, although that might also be his hair, of indeterminate length.
                  His right leg is extended forward, bent at the knee, and with the foot flat on the
                  ground. His left leg is largely hidden behind the front figure so that only the
                  foot and lower calf are seen, but it is clearly extended backward. The foot of
                  this leg stands on tiptoe. Short shadows fall behind both feet. A much longer
                  shadow falls behind both runners, extending across the ground to the right edge of
                  the image. Despair stands behind and to the right of the two running figures,
                  slightly off center of the image. He faces the viewer, standing, but with his
                  upper body leaning to the right onto a wall of his castle, perhaps in the process
                  of fainting or falling. He is a massive giant in comparison to the other figures,
                  completely naked and very muscular, with visible genitals. His head is bent
                  backwards and tilted slightly to his left, into the direction of his lean. His
                  eyes are wide, and stare forward into the distance, as if not focused on anything.
                  His mouth is open, which, combined with his eyes, imply a dazed or stunned
                  expression. His hair is short and curly. His arms are both down at his sides and
                  slack. In his left hand, he holds a massive club made of a knotty branch, which
                  rests on the ground, supporting his weight. His legs are together, but he stands
                  midstride—albeit a short stride. His left leg is slightly forward, standing
                  straight, with the foot flat on the ground. His right leg is very slightly
                  extended backward, and bent at the knee, with the foot standing on tiptoe. A dark
                  shadow extends to the right of Despair's feet, under his club and the wall to the
                  right. In the background behind the figures is Despair’s castle, Doubting Castle.
                  The structure is built around a central tower, which stands in the middle of the
                  image behind Despair. It is made of large, dark, square stones, and has a parapet
                  at the top. A large, square window is built into the center of the tower just
                  below the parapet, with nine smaller panes within, seven of which are squares, and
                  two of which are slightly irregular shaped quadrilaterals (the top line of one and
                  the bottom line of the pane above it are diagonal). A thin, arched window is built
                  into the tower to the left of this large window. A row of short spikes is built
                  into the wall to the right of the central window, just above Despair’s head. A
                  similarly parapeted wall flanks both sides of the central tower, at a slightly
                  shorter height. A second outer wall stands below this upper wall, on either side
                  of the tower. This wall is also made of dark, rectangular stones and with a
                  parapet at its top. A gate or other opening is built into this wall, right in
                  front of the central tower, and Despair stands within this gate. To the left of
                  Despair, a portion of the wall is topped with spikes, and appears to be one door
                  of the gate, opened and at an angle to the viewer. Another similar structure can
                  be seen behind and to the right of Despair, which is the portion of the lower wall
                  that he leans on. Two circular objects are stacked on top of each other at the
                  bottom of this portion of the wall, perhaps hinges for the gate. Behind Despair, a
                  short flight of stairs leads up into the central tower. The sky in the top left
                  corner of the image is dark, but streaks of light cross over this dark portion and
                  lead to brighter skies towards the center and right side of the image, indicating
                  sunrise or sunset behind the central tower.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>Christian and Hopeful are shown fleeing from Doubting Castle, with
                     Despair following behind. Christian and Hopeful both stand midstride running
                     away from the castle in the bottom-left corner of the image. Although they are
                     fairly detailed, they are not detailed enough to differentiate one from the
                     other. One stands slightly in front of the other from the viewer’s perspective,
                     obscuring parts of the back figure’s body. The front figure faces left and runs
                     in profile, but with his head and upper body turned slightly away from the
                     viewer, towards the back figure. Only the back of his head can be seen, and he
                     appears to have short hair. He wears a long, semi-transparent, long-sleeved
                     gown. His left arm is extended in front of his body, and raised at 45 degrees.
                     His hand is raised, with the palm vertical and facing left. His right arm is
                     extended slightly behind his body, and also raised at 45 degrees. The hand of
                     this arm is held parallel to the ground, with the palm down. His entire upper
                     body is bent forward at about 45 degrees, leaning into his run. His right leg
                     is extended forward slightly, bent at the knee, with the foot flat on the
                     ground. A short shadow falls behind the right foot. His left leg is extended
                     backward, bent slightly at the knee, with the foot raised off the ground. A
                     long shadow falls behind both runners, extending across the ground to the right
                     edge of the image.</illusobjdesc>

                     standing, but with his upper body leaning to the right onto a wall of his
                     castle, perhaps in the process of fainting or falling. He is a massive giant in

                  <illusobjdesc>Christian and Hopeful are shown fleeing from Doubting Castle, with
                     Despair following behind. In the background behind the figures is Despair’s
                     castle, Doubting Castle. The structure is built around a central tower, which
                     stands in the middle of the image behind Despair. It is made of large, dark,
                     square stones, and has a parapet at the top. A large, square window is built
                     into the center of the tower just below the parapet, with nine smaller panes
                     within, seven of which are squares, and two of which are slightly irregular
                     shaped quadrilaterals (the top line of one and the bottom line of the pane
                     above it are diagonal). A thin, arched window is built into the tower to the
                     left of this large window. A row of short spikes is built into the wall to the
                     right of the central window, just above Despair’s head. A similarly parapeted
                     wall flanks both sides of the central tower, at a slightly shorter height. A
                     second outer wall stands below this upper wall, on either side of the tower.
                     This wall is also made of dark, rectangular stones and with a parapet at its
                     top. A gate or other opening is built into this wall, right in front of the
                     central tower, and Despair stands within this gate. To the left of Despair, a
                     portion of the wall is topped with spikes, and appears to be one door of the
                     gate, opened and at an angle to the viewer. Another similar structure can be
                     seen behind and to the right of Despair, which is the portion of the lower wall

                     bottom of this portion of the wall, perhaps hinges for the gate. Behind
                     Despair, a short flight of stairs leads up into the central

               <illusobjdesc>Christian and Hopeful meet four shepherds on the road. Two
                  figures—Christian and Hopeful—stand on the right side of the image. They are
                  fairly detailed, but not detailed enough to differentiate one from the other,
                  although Christian is possibly the left of the two, since he leads. The left
                  figure stands slightly in front of the other from the viewer’s perspective, hiding
                  the lower portion of the back figure’s right leg. He stands midstride, walking
                  along the road, seen in profile facing left. His hair is long and curly, falling
                  down onto his neck and shoulders. His head is bent forward slightly, and his eyes
                  are raised, looking towards the four shepherds ahead of him. He has a clear Adam’s
                  apple in his neck. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved gown. His left arm is down
                  at his side, but crossed over his chest, with the hand at his right shoulder. He
                  walks with the assistance of a long, thin rod or staff, serving as a walking
                  stick. He holds the staff with one end against his right side and shoulder and the
                  other end diagonally down on the ground in front of him, almost like a crutch, so
                  he possibly holds the upper end of the staff in his left hand. The right arm is
                  also down, fully extended at his side, reaching down along the length of the
                  staff. The arm is held slightly in front of his body, holding the staff at about
                  its midpoint. He stands with one leg straight, with his foot flat on the ground.
                  His other leg is extended backward slightly, and bent at the knee, standing on
                  tiptoe. His gown covers his legs and makes it difficult to tell which leg is
                  which, but faint lines on the gown possibly indicate the calf of the bent leg,
                  indicating that it is the left, and the straight leg is his right. A second figure
                  stands to the right of the first, and slightly behind him. He also stands in
                  profile, facing left. His head is bent down, and he appears to be looking down at
                  the ground. He has long, curly hair which flows onto his neck and shoulders. He
                  wears a long, loose, long-sleeved gown. His left arm is down at his side, but
                  crossed over his chest, with the hand on the right shoulder. Only one leg is fully
                  visible, and it is straight, with the foot flat on the ground. Like the other
                  figure, his gown makes it unclear which leg this is, but it is likely his left
                  leg. The other leg is obscured by the other figure, but appears to also be
                  straight. A sheep stands behind these two figures, with its neck and head visible
                  to the left of the left figure. It holds its head down to the ground, eating
                  grass. This sheep is slightly smaller than the other five with the shepherds,
                  indicating that it may be a lamb. The left half of the image is dominated by four
                  standing shepherds. The leftmost shepherd stands facing away from the viewer,
                  although his body is turned towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long, loose,
                  long-sleeved gown and a wide-brimmed hat. His head is seen in profile, looking to
                  the right at Christian and Hopeful. His mouth is slightly open, and he has long
                  hair flowing under the brim of his hat onto his neck and shoulders, as well as a
                  curly beard. Only his right arm is visible, and it is down at his side, but bent
                  upwards at the elbow so that the forearm and hand are raised. He points with his
                  first finger up and to the right, towards the rightmost shepherd, with his thumb
                  also up and all other fingers curled into his palm. Although his left arm is not
                  visible at all, he presumably holds a shepherd’s crook in it, since the hook of
                  the staff is visible above his hat. He stands with both legs straight. His left
                  foot is turned away from the viewer, but flat on the ground, so that all we see is
                  the heel. The right foot is in profile, with the heel raised, standing on tiptoe.
                  The second shepherd from the left stands facing the viewer, but his head is turned
                  slightly towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved gown,
                  and a wide-brimmed hat, although the hat is tipped back in such a way that it
                  resembles a halo around his head. He has a long, curly beard. Lines on his
                  forehead imply an expression of concern. Although his gown hides his legs, he
                  stands with both legs straight. His feet are not visible. The hook of a shepherd’s
                  crook can be seen above and behind his hat, although it is unclear how he holds
                  the staff. His left arm is down at his side, but bent upward at the elbow so that
                  the forearm and hand are raised. His hand points to the right at Christian and
                  Hopeful, although his first finger is not fully extended. His thumb may be raised.
                  However, since the shepherds stand so close together, it is unclear if this arm is
                  actually his left arm, or the next shepherd’s right arm. The next shepherd to the
                  right (second from the right) stands facing the viewer, but his head is turned
                  slightly towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved gown,
                  and a wide-brimmed hat, although the hat is tipped back in such a way that it
                  resembles a halo around his head. He has a long, curly beard and hair. His eyes
                  are wide, looking down, and he has lines in his forehead, indicating an expression
                  of concern. Although his gown hides his legs, he stands with both legs straight.
                  His feet are not visible. The hook of a shepherd’s crook can be seen above and
                  behind his hat, although it is unclear how he holds the staff. His left arm is
                  barely visible behind his stomach, down at his side, fully extended reaching
                  downward, with the hand open and fingers spread. However, since the shepherds
                  stand so close together, it is unclear if this arm is actually his left arm, or
                  the next shepherd’s right arm. The rightmost shepherd stands facing the viewer,
                  but his head is turned slightly towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long,
                  loose, long-sleeved gown, and a wide-brimmed hat, although the hat is tipped back
                  in such a way that it resembles a halo around his head. He has a short, curly
                  beard and hair, with particularly curled locks of hair standing out on the top and
                  back of his head. His eyes are wide, looking to the right at Christian and
                  Hopeful. He has lines on his forehead, indicating an expression of concern or
                  possibly surprise when taken alongside his wide eyes. Although his gown hides his
                  legs, he stands with both legs straight. His feet appear to be visible, with the
                  right foot turned directly at the viewer, so that we see the toes, and the left
                  foot in profile, standing on tiptoe. The hook of a shepherd’s crook can be seen
                  above and behind his hat, although it is unclear how he holds the staff. His left
                  arm is down at his side, fully extended reaching downward, and held slightly away
                  from his body. The hand is open with fingers spread and palm facing out towards
                  the viewer. A sheep stands between each shepherd, with two to the right of the
                  rightmost shepherd. Only their heads and necks are visible, which are bent down
                  towards the ground, eating grass. The ground below the figures and the sheep is
                  covered in grass. In the background behind the figures, faint markings indicate
                  rolling hills covered in grasslands and possibly patches of woods. The sky in the
                  top-right corner behind Christian and Hopeful is darker than the other side, with
                  streaks of light reaching across from the left, indicating a sunrise or sunset
                  behind the four shepherds.</illusobjdesc>

                  <illusobjdesc>The left half of the image is dominated by four standing shepherds.
                     The leftmost shepherd stands facing away from the viewer, although his body is
                     turned towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved gown
                     and a wide-brimmed hat. His head is seen in profile, looking to the right at
                     Christian and Hopeful. His mouth is slightly open, and he has long hair flowing
                     under the brim of his hat onto his neck and shoulders, as well as a curly
                     beard. Only his right arm is visible, and it is down at his side, but bent
                     upwards at the elbow so that the forearm and hand are raised. He points with
                     his first finger up and to the right, towards the rightmost shepherd, with his
                     thumb also up and all other fingers curled into his palm. Although his left arm
                     is not visible at all, he presumably holds a shepherd’s crook in it, since the
                     hook of the staff is visible above his hat. He stands with both legs straight.
                     His left foot is turned away from the viewer, but flat on the ground, so that
                     all we see is the heel. The right foot is in profile, with the heel raised,
                     standing on tiptoe.</illusobjdesc>

                     The second shepherd from the left stands facing the viewer, but his head is
                     turned slightly towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long, loose,
                     long-sleeved gown, and a wide-brimmed hat, although the hat is tipped back in
                     such a way that it resembles a halo around his head. He has a long, curly
                     beard. Lines on his forehead imply an expression of concern. Although his gown
                     hides his legs, he stands with both legs straight. His feet are not visible.
                     The hook of a shepherd’s crook can be seen above and behind his hat, although
                     it is unclear how he holds the staff. His left arm is down at his side, but

                     fully extended. His thumb may be raised. However, since the shepherds stand so
                     close together, it is unclear if this arm is actually his left arm, or the next

                     spread and palm facing towards from the viewer. However, since the shepherds

                     crossing in front of his body. His hand points to the right at Christian and

                     The rightmost shepherd stands facing the viewer, but his head is turned
                     slightly towards Christian and Hopeful. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved
                     gown, and a wide-brimmed hat, although the hat is tipped back in such a way
                     that it resembles a halo around his head. He has a short, curly beard and hair,
                     with particularly curled locks of hair standing out on the top and back of his
                     head. His eyes are wide, looking to the right at Christian and Hopeful. He has
                     lines on his forehead, indicating an expression of concern or possibly surprise
                     when taken alongside his wide eyes. Although his gown hides his legs, he stands
                     with both legs straight. His feet appear to be visible, with the right foot
                     turned directly at the viewer, so that we see the toes, and the left foot in
                     profile, standing on tiptoe. The hook of a shepherd’s crook can be seen above
                     and behind his hat, although it is unclear how he holds the staff. His left arm
                     is down at his side, fully extended reaching downward, and held slightly away
                     from his body. The hand is open with fingers spread and palm facing out towards
                     the viewer. Because of how close the shepherds stand, it is difficult to tell
                     which arms belong to which shepherd. Therefore, the left arm of the shepherd
                     second from the right might actually be this shepherd's left arm. The arm is,
                     down at his side, fully extended reaching downward, with the hand open and

               <illusobjdesc>This image is a rough, unfinished sketch and therefore lacks much
                  detail. Hopeful and Christian attempt to cross the river before the Gates of
                  Heaven. Faint horizontal lines across the bottom third of the image indicate the
                  presence of the river. One horizontal line about a third of the way from the
                  bottom of the image indicates a shore or bank, upon which two angelic figures
                  stand. Two figures, Christian and Hopeful, swim through the river in the
                  lower-right corner of the image. One of the figures, presumably Christian based on
                  Bunyan's text, has sunk almost entirely into the river, so that only his head is
                  visible above the water. The head is bent back so that it is parallel with the
                  surface of the water. He faces up, and is viewed in profile. He has long, curly
                  hair which falls into the water. He looks up into Hopeful’s face. His mouth may be
                  slightly open. The other figure, presumably Hopeful, is swimming or perhaps wading
                  across the river with his chest, arms, and head above the water. He faces forward,
                  but his head is turned and tilted slightly to his left, and he looks down at
                  Christian’s face below him. His long, curly hair blows in the wind to behind him
                  to the right, over is left shoulder. His left arm is raised at about 45 degrees
                  and curled around Christian’s head, which he holds, supporting it in the crook of
                  his elbow and on his forearm. His right arm is raised horizontally and fully
                  extended. He points to the left, towards the two other figures in the image. Two
                  figures stand on the left edge of the image, at the upper bank of the river. They
                  are not as detailed as Christian and Hopeful, but detailed enough to tell that
                  they are angels. They stand side by side, and are virtually identical. The left
                  angel wears a long, loose gown. It faces forward, but with its head turned
                  slightly to the right and bent down, in the direction of Christian and Hopeful. It
                  has no eyes or facial features, but clearly looks at them. A large halo surrounds
                  the angel’s head. Its large right wing is visible behind the right side of its
                  body, folded up, but with a large bulge over the right shoulder. The right angel
                  wears a long, loose gown. It faces forward, but with its head turned slightly to
                  the right and bent down, in the direction of Christian and Hopeful. It has no eyes
                  or facial features, but clearly looks at them. A large halo surrounds the angel’s
                  head. Its large left wing is visible behind the lift side of its body, folded up,
                  but with a large bulge over the left shoulder. Small beams of light emanate from
                  the angels in all directions. Faintly drawn bush-like shapes fill the upper-right
                  quadrant of the image, indicating shrubbery, trees, or other vegetation growing
                  along the riverbank and in the background. Short, vertical lines under some of the
                  bush shapes just to the right of the angels' feet and their heads possibly
                  indicate tree trunks.</illusobjdesc>

                     long, curly hair which falls into the water. He looks up into Hopeful’s face.

                     His long, curly hair blows in the wind to behind him to the right, over is left
                     shoulder. His left arm is raised at about 45 degrees and bent around
                     Christian’s head, which he holds, supporting it in the crook of his elbow and
                     on his forearm. His right arm is raised horizontally and fully extended. He

               <illusobjdesc>Christian and Hopeful approach the Gates of Heaven, surrounded by a
                  heavenly host. Christian and Hopeful float in the center of the image. They look
                  almost identical, so it is difficult to tell which is which. Both figures are in a
                  vertical position, but hovering slightly above the ground, and thus appear to be
                  flying or floating towards the gates. The left figure faces away, but with his
                  head turned to his right and viewed in profile. He wears a long, loose,
                  long-sleeved, and semi-transparent gown, revealing a muscular physique underneath,
                  particularly along his back. His long, curly hair flows down his neck and onto his
                  left shoulder. He looks directly at the other figure to his right. His right arm
                  is raised vertically and fully extended. The hand is raised, pointing towards the
                  gates at the top of the image in the background. The hand appears to be turned
                  with the palm facing left, and fingers spread. His left arm is hidden behind the
                  right wing of the angel to his left. His legs are visible through his gown. They
                  are together, with the right leg fully extended and straight. The left leg is bent
                  slightly at the knee, with the lower leg extended slightly backward, and crossing
                  over his right ankle. The left foot is pointed, and the right foot is not visible,
                  hidden within the billowing hem of his gown. The right figure faces left and is
                  viewed in profile. He wears a long, loose, long-sleeved, and semi-transparent
                  gown. His long, curly hair flows down his neck and blows behind him in the wind.
                  He looks directly at the other figure to his left. His right arm is raised
                  vertically and fully extended. The hand is raised with the palm out towards the
                  viewer, and fingers spread, gesturing to the gates at the top of the image in the
                  background. His left arm is down at his side, but bent at the elbow so that the
                  forearm crosses over his chest. The left hand also gestures at the gates, but
                  appears to be turned with the palm facing right, with fingers spread. His body
                  twists at the waist, so that his legs are seen from behind instead of in profile.
                  His legs are faintly visible through his gown. They are together, with the right
                  leg fully extended and straight. The left leg is bent slightly at the knee, with
                  the lower leg extended slightly backward, and crossing over his right leg. Neither
                  foot is clearly seen, hidden in the billowing hem of the gown, but a faint outline
                  of the left foot might be visible, and it appears pointed. Christian and Hopeful
                  are flanked on either side by an angel flying alongside them. The left angel faces
                  away from the viewer, but its head is turned to the right and seen in profile. Its
                  head is bent down slightly as it looks at Christian and Hopeful directly to its
                  right. Its long, curly hair flows down its neck and onto its left shoulder. Its
                  wings are both fully unfolded and raised, forming a V overhead and ending in sharp
                  points. The point of the right wing almost touches the point of the other angel’s
                  left wing. Feathers are drawn into the wings along their lower edges. The angel
                  wears a long, loose gown. Its legs are together, fully extended, and straight,
                  although they cannot be clearly seen through its gown. One foot, perhaps the left
                  foot, can be seen through the hem of the gown, and it is pointed. The right angel
                  faces away from the viewer, but its head is turned to the left and seen in
                  profile. Its head is bent down slightly as it looks at Christian and Hopeful
                  directly to its left. Its long hair flows down its neck, blowing in the wind
                  behind him. Its wings are both fully unfolded and raised, forming a V overhead and
                  ending in sharp points. The point of the left wing almost touches the point of the
                  other angel’s right wing. Feathers are drawn into the wings along their lower
                  edges. The angel wears a long, loose, semi-transparent gown. Its legs are together
                  and partially visible through the gown, particularly its left leg. This leg is
                  bent at the knee, with the thigh vertical and the lower leg raised at a 90 degree
                  angle and extended backward. From the viewing angle, we see the sole of the foot,
                  with a couple toes clearly drawn, and the bulge of the calf behind the foot. The
                  right leg appears to be fully extended and straight, and the foot may be visible
                  through the hem, although not clearly. It appears to be pointed. The background
                  and upper portions of the image are filled with a host of many angels, including
                  four that are larger and more detailed than the others. In the upper-left corner,
                  one angel faces forward with its head tilted slightly to the left. It appears to
                  have its wings spread, almost horizontally, in a shallow V. The right arm appears
                  to be raised at 45 degrees. It wears a long, loose gown. A second head-like shape
                  floats over this angel’s right shoulder, possibly the head of another angel behind
                  it. Behind these figures are the suggestion of additional heads of angels. Another
                  group of figures floats below and to the right of this figure. One angel in this
                  group is prominent and hovers in front of others, who are faintly suggested by
                  their heads and gowned bodies. The central figure wears a long, loose gown and
                  faces forward; it may look toward the right. Its arms appear to be down at its
                  sides, close to its body. Another pair of figures floats to the right of this
                  group. One angel of the pair is larger and more clearly depicted. It wears a long,
                  loose gown and faces forward and to the right. Its arms are down at its sides,
                  close to its body. The second angel in this pair hovers to the right of the first,
                  and is suggested by a faint head and body, with little detail. A final angel
                  floats in the upper-right corner of the image, facing forward. Its head is tilted
                  to the left and hangs down. It appears to have its wings spread, almost
                  horizontally, in a shallow V, although the wings may instead be arms. The
                  near-horizontal position of the wings and the hanging head possibly suggest a
                  crucified posture. A third arm-like appendage is raised at 45 degrees, but bent at
                  the elbow so that the forearm and hand are raised. This arm may belong to another
                  figure hidden behind the angel. A second head-like shape over the left shoulder of
                  the angel may also belong to another figure hidden behind. Several faintly drawn
                  heads and bodies of other angelic figures appear in the center of the image below
                  the gates and city in the background. The sky behind Christian, Hopeful, and all
                  the angels is filled with dark, billowing clouds that rise to a fiery, smoky
                  bulbous shape in the center of the image behind the points of the lower angels’
                  inner wings. A heavenly city sits the very top of the image in the background,
                  behind the large heavenly host. The city is composed of several mountain-shaped
                  triangular spires, forming a crownlike shape. A dome stands at the far right end
                  of the city, topped by a cross, reminiscent of St. Paul's Cathedral. The sun rises
                  or sets behind the city, filling the upper portions of the sky with beams of
                  light. Faintly drawn shapes at either end of the city are possibly two more
                  angels. The left one appears to be facing forward, floating in a near vertical
                  position, with both arms raised at 45 degrees. The right one appears to be
                  floating in a horizontal position, with its head to the right. A small line
                  extending to the left from this angel indicates that it may be blowing on a
                  trumpet or other horn instrument. Bushy shrubs or trees spread along the lower
                  edge of the image, below the feet of Christian, Hopeful, and the lower
                  angels.</illusobjdesc>

                     look almost identical, so it is difficult to tell which is which. Both figures
                     are in a vertical position, but hovering slightly above the ground, and thus
                     appear to be flying or floating towards the gates. The left figure faces away,
                     but with his head turned to his right and viewed in profile. He wears a long,
                     loose, long-sleeved, and semi-transparent gown, revealing a muscular physique
                     underneath, particularly along his back. His long, curly hair flows down his
                     neck and onto his left shoulder. He looks directly at the other figure to his
                     right. His right arm is raised vertically and fully extended. The hand is
                     raised, pointing towards the gates at the top of the image in the background.
                     The hand appears to be turned with the palm facing left, and fingers spread.
                     His left arm is hidden behind the right wing of the angel to his left. His legs
                     are visible through his gown. They are together, with the right leg fully
                     extended and straight. The left leg is bent slightly at the knee, with the
                     lower leg extended slightly backward, and crossing over his right ankle. The
                     left foot is pointed, and the right foot is not visible, hidden within the
                     billowing hem of his gown.</illusobjdesc>

                     semi-transparent gown. His long, curly hair flows down his neck and blows
                     behind him in the wind. He looks directly at the other figure to his left. His
                     right arm is raised vertically and fully extended. The hand is raised with the
                     palm out towards the viewer, and fingers spread, gesturing to the gates at the
                     top of the image in the background. His left arm is down at his side, but bent
                     at the elbow so that the forearm crosses over his chest. The left hand also
                     gestures at the gates, but appears to be turned with the palm facing right,
                     with fingers spread. His body twists at the waist, so that his legs are seen
                     from behind instead of in profile. His legs are faintly visible through his
                     gown. They are together, with the right leg fully extended and straight. The
                     left leg is bent slightly at the knee, with the lower leg extended slightly
                     backward, and crossing over his right leg. Neither foot is clearly seen, hidden
                     in the billowing hem of the gown, but a faint outline of the left foot might be
                     visible, and it appears pointed.</illusobjdesc>

                     is turned to the right and seen in profile. Its head is bent down slightly as
                     it looks at Christian and Hopeful directly to its right. Its long, curly hair
                     flows down its neck and onto its left shoulder. Its wings are both fully
                     unfolded and raised, forming a V overhead and ending in sharp points. The point
                     of the right wing almost touches the point of the other angel’s left wing.
                     Feathers are drawn into the wings along their lower edges. The angel wears a

                     they cannot be clearly seen through its gown. One foot, perhaps the left foot,

                     looks at Christian and Hopeful directly to its left. Its long hair flows down
                     its neck, blowing in the wind behind him. Its wings are both fully unfolded and
                     raised, forming a V overhead and ending in sharp points. The point of the left
                     wing almost touches the point of the other angel’s right wing. Feathers are
                     drawn into the wings along their lower edges. The angel wears a long, loose,

                     gown, particularly its left leg. This leg is bent at the knee, with the thigh
                     vertical and the lower leg raised at a 90 degree angle and extended backward.
                     From the viewing angle, we see the sole of the foot, with a couple toes clearly
                     drawn, and the bulge of the calf behind the foot. The right leg appears to be
                     fully extended and straight, and the foot may be visible through the hem,
                     although not clearly. It appears to be pointed.</illusobjdesc>
