                    <illusobjdesc>Just left of center in this very faint drawing, three figures, sitting or kneeling, are partially visible.  The central figure is the most detailed and appears to face forward with head tilted up and to the left.  This figure's right arm may be bent at the elbow.  Both legs of this sitting figure are extended downward and may be crossed near the ankle.  To the right of this figure, a second figure's head and arms, both of which are bent upward at 90 degrees, are visible.  This figure may clench its hands into fists.  The figure far left sits or kneels facing right, with left arm raised at 135 degrees and right arm lowered at 45 degrees.  All three may be engaged in an animated conversation.  There is a form behind and above the figure on the left (perhaps a tree?) though the details of this form are indistinct.  Additional lines above and to the right of the figures may represent a mountain landscape.  A few faint lines upper right might represent two(?) kneeling figures, oriented vertically and facing right toward the bottom of the leaf.</illusobjdesc>
