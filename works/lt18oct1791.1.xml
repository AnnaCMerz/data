                <compdate value="1791.A">1791<note>Willey Reveley's letter to Blake is dated "Oct
                        18" in Reveley's hand, but the partial postmark stamp, "C OCT / 7", suggests
                        it may have actually been posted by [1]7 October 1791. Bentley (<hi rend="i"
                            >Writings</hi> volume 2, page 1521) notes "The date of the letter is in
                        some doubt [...] for though Reveley clearly dated the letter 'Oct 18', the
                        numeral in the postmark is equally clearly a '7'. I cannot reconcile these
                        facts." Blake's undated reply to Reveley was written on the back of the
                        letter he received by post from Reveley. According to Essick (<hi rend="i"
                            >Huntington</hi>, page 185), "Blake refers to his willingness to engrave
                        for Reveley 'by the end of January' some illustrations for James Stuart and
                        Nicholas Revett, <hi rend="i">The Antiquities of Athens</hi>. Volume 3
                        (1794) of that work (see Part III, section B, No. 48) includes 4 plates by
                        Blake dated 3 April 1792 in the imprints. Thus, Blake must have written his
                        note, a direct reply to Reveley's letter, shortly after 18 October 1791."

                            before the single horizontal line was added to strike the whole
                            line of text. Erdman (page 699) reads this deleted word as "tho".</note>
