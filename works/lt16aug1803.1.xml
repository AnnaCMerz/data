                         <p>Blake's letter is written on two leaves. The letter appears on the recto

                              (Object 4) of the second leaf. These leaves folded to form a sealed
                              letter packet. The address appears on the verso (Object 1) of the
                              second leaf, which would have been the exterior sealed packet.</p>
