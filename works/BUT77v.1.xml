                    <illusobjdesc>A gowned figure visible from the waist down is depicted in this
                        drawing. The figure is seated with knees turned to the left. It is unclear
                        whether the chair on which she sits is visible next to her hips at right or
                        if this material is part of the gown's drapery. Two vertical lines appear
                        near the left edge of the design, and two right hands, one above the other,
                        are shown behind these lines with palms facing forward, fingers pointing

                        of a seated girl playing the harp, indicating the figure in this drawing is
