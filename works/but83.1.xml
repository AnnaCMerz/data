            <updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a
                digital edition of forty-three pencil drawings produced by Blake during his first
                decade as an independent artist, 1779-1790. Drawing lies at the core of Blake's life
                as an artist. Pencil was his preferred medium for sketching—more flexible, less
                expensive, and more easily corrected than pen and ink or chalk. Preliminary work
                with the pencil preceded more finished work, either as separate sketches for prints
                and paintings or as drawings underlying water colors. Blake's nineteenth-century
                writings on the arts testify to his conviction that drawing was fundamental to all
                pictorial expression: "The distinction that is made in modern times between a
                Painting and a Drawing proceeds from ignorance of art. The merit of a Picture is the
                same as the merit of a Drawing" (*A Descriptive Catalogue*, Erdman page 549); "Let a
                Man who has made a Drawing go on &amp; on &amp; he will produce a Picture or Painting but if
                he chooses to leave off before he has spoild it he will Do a Better Thing[.]"
                (*Public Address*, Erdman page 576); "Painting is Drawing on Canvas &amp; Engraving is
                Drawing on Copper &amp; Nothing Else…&amp; he who Draws best must be the best Artist…."
                (*Public Address*, Erdman page 582); "Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather
                madness, for I am really drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or
                graver into my hand…." (letter to William Hayley, 1804, Erdman page 757). <lb/>
                <lb/> Blake no doubt executed a great many more pencil drawings than those extant
                today. Sketches were not intended for exhibition or sale; most were probably
                discarded, while others may have been retained only because of more developed
                compositions on the other side of the leaves. Even the slightest and least
                aesthetically ambitious drawings offer insights into the origins and earliest
                realizations of Blake’s designs. These first thoughts on paper often tell us more
                about Blake’s habits of mind, when joined by eye and hand, than more finished works.
                Sketches are “the first fruits of [Blake’s] imagination,” as Geoffrey Keynes states
                in the introduction to his *Pencil Drawings of William Blake* (1927). <lb/>
                <lb/> The forty-three pencil drawings presented here, produced in Blake’s first
                decade as an independent artist, show his early debt to academic standards of
                precise copying and to the neoclassical emphasis on outline. The first four works
                may have been drawn while Blake was a student in the Royal Academy schools. Other
                sketches are preliminaries for some of Blake’s most important designs. Among these
                are the *Study for “Glad Day”, or “Albion Rose”* ( Object 6), Blake’s iconic vision
                of the human form divine in energetic pose, and three sketches (Objects 34-36) for
                illustrations to *Tiriel*, the only group of finished drawings Blake composed for
                one of his own poems. Several sketches are early efforts at picturing events in the
                Bible, Blake’s main inspiration for designs throughout his life. This biblical
                cluster includes *The Resurrection of the Dead* (Object 10), *Samuel Presenting Saul
                to the People* (Object 15), and *Job’s Wife and Other Sketches* (Object 31). Other
                studies, such as *Ugolino in Prison* and its verso (Objects 21-22), reveal the
                beginnings of subjects also of lifelong interest for Blake. Only a few drawings for
                Blake’s illuminated books have survived, but studies such as *Sketches for “The Book
                of Thel”* and *A Standing and a Recumbent Figure* (Objects 37-39) offer fascinating
                glimpses into Blake’s methods of graphic production and revision. <lb/>

                    <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, a gowned female figure sits
                        facing right and holds a nude child with short curly hair who faces left and
                        wraps at least its left arm around her neck. According to Butlin 83, these
                        figures are the Madonna and Christ child enthroned, but this identification
                        is not certain. The figures are surrounded by a several circular lines that
                        may suggest a mandorla, perhaps with fire at top. In the lower left corner,
                        to be seen from the left-hand side of the paper, is a second seated figure,
                        likely female, who faces right but turns her head to look forward. Her right
                        arm appears bent upward at the elbow and her left extended near her lap. The
                        back of the chair on which she sits is covered with drapery. Above this
                        figure at left is a sketch of a figure's head and torso facing forward and
                        slightly left. Below the central figures at right is a partial sketch of
                        what might be a forward-facing right shoulder covered with drapery. A
                        drawing of a single leg seen in profile facing right is visible against the
                        right margin, and, to the immediate left, a crossed-out sketch of a foot
                        pointing right.</illusobjdesc>

                        <illusobjdesc>In the center of the composition, a gowned female figure sits
                            facing right and holds a nude child in her lap in an embrace. She has
                            long hair and turns her head down to look at the child whose face she
                            may touch (or almost touch) with her own. Both arms are bent and wrapped
                            around the child; her legs are also bent at the knee with the left leg
                            slightly drawn up. According to Butlin 83, these figures are the Madonna
                            and Christ child enthroned, but this identification is not
                            certain.</illusobjdesc>

                            and wraps at least its left arm around her neck in an embrace. With bent

                            turns its head up to look at (and perhaps touch) the woman's face.
