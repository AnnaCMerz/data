                <compdate value="1788">c. 1788<note>Fuseli's imaginary portrait of Michelangelo, with the legs added, was engraved by Blake and first published in Henry Fuseli, <hi rend="i">Lectures on Painting</hi>, 1801.  There is good circumstantial evidence, however, for concluding that both the pen and ink drawing by Fuseli and Blake's added sketch were executed at a much earlier date.  The drawings are on the same paper of approximately the same size (within 1 mm. in height and 6 mm. in width) as Fuseli's pen and ink preliminary sketch for the frontispiece, engraved by Blake, for John Caspar Lavater, <hi rend="i">Aphorisms on Man</hi>, 1788, translated and edited by Fuseli.  The brown ink and style of execution are the same in the two Fuseli drawings.  The fragmentary watermark in this drawing of Michelangelo is very probably the upper part of the shield and GR watermark in the drawing for the <hi rend="i">Aphorisms</hi> preliminary drawing.  These two leaves were almost certainly cut from the same larger sheet of paper.  Fuseli may very well have drawn his portrait of Michelangelo with the intention of having it engraved for an illustration to his own <hi rend="i">Aphorisms on Art</hi>, left unpublished until after Fuseli's death.  Thus, a date of c. 1788 for these drawings by Fuseli and Blake, and perhaps even for Blake's execution of the Michelangelo portrait engraving, seems probable.  This dating was first proposed in Ruthven Todd, "Two Blake Prints and Two Fuseli Drawings," <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 5.3 (winter 1971-72): 173-81.</note>

We know from that engraving and from Linnell's inscription on the drawing (see that Textual Transcription) that the figure is Michelangelo.  He appears to wear shoes and a knee-length coat and breeches(?), suggesting he is male.  His left foot is extended in front of his right with a slightly bent knee.  His bent right arm is visible by his side, and he may hold something in his right hand, though this object is indistinguishable.</illusobjdesc>
