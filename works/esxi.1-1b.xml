            <seriesstmt>The William Blake Archive</seriesstmt>
<updatestmt>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of nineteen separate prints designed and etched or engraved by Blake. The original works are housed in seven collections, including the Bodleian Library, British Museum, Robert N. Essick collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and National Gallery of Art, Washington. These separate prints join two others, <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and <hi rend="i">George Cumberland’s Card</hi>, and four series of prints, all previously published, to complete this important category of Blake's endeavors as a printmaker.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
The new group of nineteen includes Blake’s first separate engraving, <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, executed while still an apprentice, and two of his masterpieces in mixed-method etching/engraving, the large <hi rend="i">Job</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi> plates. <hi rend="i">The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lucifer and the Pope in Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi> depict Blake's response to the political revolutions of the late eighteenth century. Blake printed these three, plus <hi rend="i">A Dream of Thiralatha</hi> and <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea Preaching to the Inhabitants of Britain</hi>, in colors as part of his development of relief and planographic color printing in the mid-1790s. Other plates, ranging from <hi rend="i">The Approach of Doom</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Enoch</hi> lithograph and <hi rend="i">The Chaining of Orc</hi>, testify to Blake's lifelong experimentation with innovative graphic techniques. He produced <hi rend="i">Deaths Door</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Virgil Relief Etching</hi> as book illustrations but they were never published as such and exist only as unique, separate impressions. Introductions to each work offer information on medium, changes in state, dating, and subject. Blake’s <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> etching/engraving, sometimes considered a separate plate, is included among the Illuminated Books in the Archive.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> 
Late in his career, c. 1820-25 or even extending into his final year, Blake returned to several of his earlier separate engravings, dramatically revising the interplay of darkness and light in their designs and adding new inscriptions on some plates that alter their meaning. These final states of <hi rend="i">Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, <hi rend="i">Ezekiel</hi>, <hi rend="i">The Accusers</hi>, <hi rend="i">Albion rose</hi>, and Blake's largest and most ambitious print, <hi rend="i">Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims</hi>, are included, along with extant earlier states. The publication of these and other multiple states and printings offer insights into Blake's development as a printmaker and changes in his thematic interests over several decades.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>

                    <illusobjdesc>Joseph of Arimathea, the tall male figure with a long beard and gown, stands near the right edge of the composition and faces left toward a crowd of figures. He short hair extends to the right, as if blown in the wind, and his mouth may be open. He holds a staff that rests on the ground with his bent left arm; his right arm is extended horizontally, palm facing down, over the heads of several figures at left. His left foot is visible beneath his gown, and he appears to stand on a stone that may be partially covered with moss or lichens. A dark form that may be a shadow is visible to the left of this stone. Nine figures stand in the foreground to the left of Joseph of Arimathea, and all appear in despair or distress. The second figure from the right has long hair and may be female. She stands facing forward with head bent forward to rest on the shoulder of the male figure at left. She may wear tights. Her left arm is at her side and bent upward slightly to hold the arm or hand of the male figure beside her. Her right leg appears to be bent. The male figure on whom she leans is the third figure from the right, and he stands facing forward with head raised, perhaps to look toward Joseph of Arimathea's outstretched arm. He has short hair and wears tights as well as a cloak across his right shoulder. His left arm is at his side, and he may hold hands with the female figure who leans on him at right. His right arm is also at his right and bent to hold or touch the hand of the male figure standing to his left. His right leg is extended slightly to the left and bent. The fourth figure from the right appears to be a male figure with short curly hair who wears tights. He stands facing left with head turned away from the viewer. His left arm is at his side and bent slightly to hold or touch the hand of the male figure to his right. The fifth figure from the right is a female figure who stands facing forward and right with head down. She has long hair and wears a gown. Her left arm is bent upward, and her hand is raised, palm facing forward with fingers spread. The sixth figure from the right is a male figure who stands facing right with head down. He has short curly hair and wears tights. His arms are bent upward and crossed in front of his chest. He may point down with the index finger of his left hand. The seventh figure from the right is a male figure who stands facing forward and right with closed eyes. He has short hair and a mustache and beard. He wears a long cloak that covers his entire body. His head appears to be bent down slightly. The eighth figure from the right appears to be a female figure with long hair who faces away from the viewer. She wears a long gown and bends her head back to look up. She raises both arms, which are bent, above her head and clasps her hands together, perhaps in a gesture of prayer. Her right leg is bent and extended backward; her right foot is visible beneath her gown. The ninth figure from the right is a female figure who stands facing forward and turns her head to the left to look toward the male figure who embraces her. She has long hair and wears a gown. Her mouth is open and her eyes are raised. She bends both arms upward with hands raised, palms facing forward. Her left leg is visibly bent beneath her gown. The tenth figure from the right and the leftmost figure in the foreground is a male figure who stands facing right. He has short curly hair and wears tights. He raises his bent right arm to embrace the female figure standing beside him at right. He also looks toward her. His left arm is raised vertically, and he raised two fingers of his left hand. The figure's left leg is extended forward. Shadowy forms that may represent additional figures' heads in the crowd are visible behind the nine figures standing in the foreground. The branch of a tree that may have some leaves extends over the bearded figure of Joseph of Arimathea in the upper right corner. A hill or mountain is visible beneath this branch. Six vertical lines above the figures at left suggest spikes or poles(?). The red coloring of the background sky may indicate a sunrise or sunset.</illusobjdesc>
