When we all girls & boys,
In our youth-time were seen,
On the Ecchoing Green.
Till the little ones weary
No more can be merry
The sun does descend,
And our sports have an end:
Round the laps of their mothers.
Many sisters and brothers,
Like birds in their nest.
Are ready for rest:
And sport no more seen,
On the darkening Green"

Like Women & Children were taken away as on wings
Of dovelike softness, & shadowy habitations prepared for them

Neither did any lack or fall into Error without
A Shadow to repose in all the Days of happy Eternity
Into this pleasant Shadow Beulah. all Ololon descended

All Beulah wept. for they saw the Lord coming in the Clouds
And the Shadows of Beulah terminate in rocky Albion-

Oppos'd to Mercy, and the Divine Delusion Jesus be no more
Suddenly around Milton on my Path, the Starry Seven
Burnd terrible"
milton.c.illbk.43,milton.a.illbk.40,"my Path became a solid fire, as bright
As the clear Sun & Milton silent came down on my Path.
And there went forth from the Starry limbs of the Seven: Forms
Human; with Trumpets innumerable, sounding articulate
As the Seven spake; and they stood in a mighty Column of Fire
Surrounding Felphams Vale, reaching to the Mundane Shell, Saying
Awake Albion awake! reclaim thy Reasoning Spectre. Subdue
Him to the Divine Mercy, Cast him down into the Lake
Of Los, that ever burneth with fire, ever & ever Amen!
Let the Four Zoa's awake from Slumbers of Six Thousand Years
Then loud the Furnaces of Los were heard! & seen as Seven Heavens
Stretching from south to north over the mountains of Albion
Satan heard; trembling round his Body, he incircled it
He trembled with exceeding great trembling & astonishment
Howling in his Spectre round his Body hungring to devour
But fearing for the pain for if he touches a Vital,
His torment is unendurable; therefore he cannot devour:
But howls round it as a lion round his prey continually
Loud Satan thunderd, loud & dark upon mild Felphams Shore
Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets & with Fiery Flame
An awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work
Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted 
(Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death) to imitate
The Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by
His Cherubim & Seraphim in ever happy Eternity
Beneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand Death on his left
And Ancient Night spread over all the heavn his Mantle of Laws
He trembled with exceeding great trembling & astonishment
Then Albion rose up in the Night of Beulah on his Couch
Of dread repose seen by the visionary eye; his face is toward
The east, toward Jerusalems Gates: groaning he sat above
His rocks. London & Bath & Legions & Edinburgh
Are the four pillars of his Throne; his left foot near London
Covers the shades of Tyburn"

bb470.1.comb.01,bb470.2.comb.01,"Little TOM the Sailor
And does then the Ocean possess
The promising, brave, little youth,
Who display'd, in a scene of distress,
Such Tenderness, Courage, and Truth?
Little Tom is a Cottagers Son;
His years not amounting to ten!
But the Dawn of his Manhood begun
With a Soul like the noblest of Men.
In an Hospital, distant from Home,
He lost his unfortunate Sire;
And his Mother was tempted to roam,
But to see that kind Father expire.
To depart from her Cottage was hard;
To desert the dear dying was worse,
Tho'! She had an Ideot to guard,
And a sick little Infant to nurse.
The brave little Tom tried to chear
The Grief that He shudder'd to see:
""Go! Mother (He said) without Fear!
Go! and leave these poor creatures to me!
Go you my sick Father restore!
And I will take Care of these two:
I will not stir out of the Door,
For what without me could they do?
I will carefully dress them, and feed.
Go you our dear Father to save!
I will not desert them indeed:""
And Tom kept the promise he gave,
But his Mother a Widow came back;
Want and Sorrow her Portion must be;
And her Heart, on Necessity's Rack,
Has sent little Thomas to Sea.
O Sea! Thou grand Servant of God!
The Children of Britain defend!
As a braver the Deck never trod,
Little Thomas will find Thee a Friend:
And when He's aloft in the Shrouds,
If a Storm threats aloud to destroy,
His Fathers free Soul, in the Clouds,
Will watch o'er the venturous Boy:
I hear, when the Tempests appall,
That Spirit paternal exclaim
""O God! Thou Protector of All!
Let me shelter this dear little Frame!
A Defender, with Honour, his Due!
In the Man may his Country admire!
Since the Child was a Guardian so true
To the desolate Cot of his Sire.""

But they shall rot on desart sands, & consume in bottomless deeps,
To make the desarts blossom, & the deeps shrink to their fountains,
And to renew"
america.I.illbk.10,america.b.illbk.10,"the fiery joy, and burst the stony roof.
That pale religious letchery, seeking Virginity,
May find it in a harlot, and in coarse-clad honesty
The undefil'd tho' ravish'd in her cradle night and morn:
For every thing that lives is holy, life delights in life;
Because the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd.
Fires inwrap the earthly globe, yet man is not consumd;
Amidst the lustful fires he walks; his feet become like brass, 
His knees and thighs like silver, & his breast and head like gold"

Now thou maist marry Bromions harlot, and protect the child
Of Bromions rage, that Oothoon shall put forth in nine moons
time
Then storms rent Theotormons limbs; he rolld his waves around,
And folded his black jealous waters round the adulterate pair
Bound back to back in Bromions caves terror & meekness dwell
At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the threshold hard
With secret tears; beneath him sound like waves on a desart shore 
The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money,
That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires
Of lust, that belch incessant from the summits of the earth
Oothoon weeps not; she cannot weep! her tears are locked up;
But she can howl incessant writhing her soft snowy limbs.
And calling Theotormons Eagles to prey upon her flesh.
I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air,
Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect.
The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.
The Eagles at her call descend & rend their bleeding prey;
Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile;
As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure & smiles
The Daughters of Albion hear her woes. & eccho back her sighs.
Why does my Theotormon sit weeping upon the threshold:
And Oothoon hovers by his side, perswading him in vain:
I cry arise O Theotormon for the village dog
Barks at the breaking day. the nightingale has done lamenting.
The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the Eagle returns
From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east;
Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake
The sun that sleeps too long. Arise my Theotormon I am pure.
Because the night is gone that clos'd me in its deadly black.
They told me that the night & day were all that I could see;
They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up.
And they inclos'd my infinite brain into a narrow circle.
And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning 
Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.
Instead of morn arises a bright shadow. like an eye
In the eastern cloud; instead of night a sickly charnel house;
That Theotormon hears me not! to him the night and morn
Are both alike: a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears"

With secret tears; beneath him sound like waves on a desart shore 
The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money,
That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires
Of lust, that belch incessant from the summits of the earth
Oothoon weeps not"
vda.c.illbk.05,vda.p.illbk.05,"she cannot weep! her tears are locked up;
But she can howl incessant writhing her soft snowy limbs.
And calling Theotormons Eagles to prey upon her flesh.
I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air.
Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect.
The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.
The Eagles at her call descend & rend their bleeding prey;
Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile;
As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure & smiles"
vda.c.illbk.05,vda.p.illbk.05,"The Daughters of Albion hear her woes. & eccho back her sighs.
Why does my Theotormon sit weeping upon the threshold"
vda.c.illbk.05,vda.p.illbk.05,"And Oothoon hovers by his side, perswading him in vain:
I cry arise O Theotormon for the village dog
Barks at the breaking day, the nightingale has done lamenting,
The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the Eagle returns
From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east;
Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake
The sun that sleeps too long. Arise my Theotormon I am pure.
Because the night is gone that clos'd me in its deadly black.
They told me that the night & day were all that I could see;
They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up.
And they inclos'd my infinite brain into a narrow circle,
And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning 
Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.
Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye
In the eastern cloud"

The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbet; watch the roots, 
the lion, the tyger. the horse. the elephant, watch

The cistern contains; the fountain overflows 
One thought, fills immensity. 
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man 
will avoid you, 
Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth.

Every Poem must necessarily be a perfect Unity, but why
 Homers is peculiarly so. I cannot tell: he has told the
 story of Bellerophon & omitted the Judgment of Paris which
 is not only a part, but a principal part of Homers subject
 But when a Work has Unity it is as much in a Part as in the
 Whole. the Torso is as much a Unity as the Laocoon
 As Unity is the cloke of folly so Goodness is the cloke of
 knavery Those who will have Unity exclusively in Homer
 come out with a Moral like a sting in the tail: Aristotle says
 Characters are either Good or Bad: now Goodness or Badness
 has nothing to do with Character. an Apple tree a Pear tree
 a Horse a Lion. are Characters but a Good Apple tree or a
 Bad. is an Apple tree still: a Horse is not more a Lion for
 being a Bad Horse, that is its Character"

 Badness is another consideration.

The footsteps, and infixing deep the feet in marble beds:
That Milton labourd with his journey. & his feet bled sore
Upon the clay now chang'd to marble; also Urizen rose.
And met him on the shores of Arnon; & by the streams of the brooks
Silent they met. and silent strove among the streams of Arnon
Even to Mahanaim, when with cold hand Urizen stoop'd down
And took up water from the river Jordan: pouring on
To Miltons brain the icy fluid from his broad cold palm.
But Milton took of the red clay of Succoth. moulding it with care
Between his palms; and filling up the furrows of many years
Beginning at the feet of Urizen, and on the bones
Creating new flesh on the Demon cold, and building him,
As with new clay a Human form in the Valley of Beth Peor.

One to the North. named Urthona; One to the South. named Urizen;
One to the East, named Luvah: One to the West, named Tharmas
They are the Four Zoa's that stood around the Throne Divine!
But when Luvah assum'd the World of Urizen to the South;
And Albion was slain upon his mountains, & in his tent;
All fell towards the Center in dire ruin, sinking down.
And in the South remains a burning fire; in the East a void.
In the West, a world of raging waters; in the North a solid,
Unfathomable! without end, But in the midst of these,

By Differences between Ideas, that Ideas themselves, (which are
The Divine Members) may be slain in offerings for sin
O dreadful Loom of Death! O piteous Female forms compelld
To weave the Woof of Death. On Camberwell Tirzahs Courts
Malahs on Blackheath, Rahab & Noah, dwell on Windsors heights
Where once the Cherubs of Jerusalem spread to Lambeths Vale
Milcahs Pillars shine from Harrow to Hampstead where Hoglah
On Highgates heights magnificent Weaves over trembling Thames
To Shooters Hill and thence to Blackheath the dark Woof! Loud
Loud roll the Weights & Spindles over the whole Earth let down
On all sides round to the Four Quarters of the World, eastward on 
Europe to Euphrates & Hindu, to Nile & back in Clouds
Of Death across the Atlantic to America North & South
So spoke Ololon in reminiscence astonishd, but they
Could not behold Golgonooza without passing the Polypus
A wondrous journey not passable by Immortal feet, & none
But the Divine Saviour can pass it without annihilation.
For Golgonooza cannot be seen till having passd the Polypus
It is viewed on all sides round by a Four-fold Vision
Or till you become Mortal & Vegetable in Sexuality
Then you behold its mighty Spires & Domes of ivory & gold
And Ololon examined all the Couches of the Dead.
Even of Los & Enitharmon & all the Sons of Albion
And his Four Zoas terrified & on the verge of Death
In midst of these was Miltons Couch, & when they saw Eight
Immortal Starry-Ones, guarding the Couch in flaming fires
They thunderous utterd all a universal groan falling down
Prostrate before the Starry Eight asking with tears forgiveness
Confessing their crime with humiliation and sorrow,
O how the Starry Eight rejoic'd to see Ololon descended:
And now that a wide road was open to Eternity,
By Ololons descent thro Beulah to Los & Enitharmon.
For mighty were the multitudes of Ololon, vast the extent
Of their great sway, reaching from Ulro to Eternity
Surrounding the Mundane Shell outside in its Caverns
And through Beulah. and all silent forbore to contend
With Ololon for they saw the Lord in the Clouds of Ololon
There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find
Nor can his Watch Fiends find it, but the Industrious find
This Moment & it multiply, & when it once is found
It renovates every Moment of the Day if rightly placed
In this Moment Ololon descended to Los & Enitharmon
Unseen beyond the Mundane Shell Southward in Miltons track
Just in this Moment when the morning odours rise abroad
And first from the Wild Thyme, stands a Fountain in a rock
Of crystal flowing into two Streams, one flows thro Golgonooza
And thro Beulah to Eden beneath Los's western Wall
The other flows thro the Aerial Void & all the Churches
Meeting again in Golgonooza beyond Satans Seat
The Wild Thyme is Los's Messenger to Eden, a mighty Demon
Terrible deadly & poisonous his presence in Ulro dark
Therefore he appears only a small Root creeping in grass
Covering over the Rock of Odours his bright purple mantle
Beside the Fount above the Larks Nest in Golgonooza
Luvah slept here in death & here is Luvahs empty Tomb
Ololon sat beside this Fountain on the Rock of Odours.
Just at the place to where the Lark mounts, is a Crystal Gate
It is the enterance of the First Heaven named Luther: for
The Lark is Loss Messenger thro the Twenty-seven Churches
That the Seven Eyes of God who walk even to Satans Seat
Thro all the Twenty-seven Heavens may not slumber nor sleep
But the Larks Nest is at the Gate of Los, at the eastern
Gate of wide Golgonooza & the Lark is Los's Messenger"

Now thou maist marry Bromions harlot, and protect the child
Of Bromions rage, that Oothoon shall put forth in nine moons
time
Then storms rent Theotormons limbs; he rolld his waves around.
And folded his black jealous waters round the adulterate pair
Bound back to back in Bromions caves terror & meekness dwell
At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the threshold hard
With secret tears; beneath him sound like waves on a desart shore 
The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money,
That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires
Of lust, that belch incessant from the summits of the earth
Oothoon weeps not; she cannot weep! her tears are locked up;
But she can howl incessant writhing her soft snowy limbs.
And calling Theotormons Eagles to prey upon her flesh.
I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air,
Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect,
The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.
The Eagles at her call descend & rend their bleeding prey;
Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile;
As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure & smiles
The Daughters of Albion hear her woes. & eccho back her sighs.
Why does my Theotormon sit weeping upon the threshold:
And Oothoon hovers by his side, perswading him in vain:
I cry arise O Theotormon for the village dog
Barks at the breaking day. the nightingale has done lamenting,
The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the Eagle returns
From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east;
Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake
The sun that sleeps too long. Arise my Theotormon I am pure.
Because the night is gone that clos'd me in its deadly black.
They told me that the night & day were all that I could see;
They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up.
And they inclos'd my infinite brain into a narrow circle,
And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning 
Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.
Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye
In the eastern cloud; instead of night a sickly charnel house;
That Theotormon hears me not! to him the night and morn
Are both alike: a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears"

From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east;
Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake

great poet King David desired so fervently & invokes 
so patheticly, saying by this he conquers enemies & 
governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God. that we 
cursed in his name all the deities of surrounding 
nations, and asserted that they had rebelled; from 
these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nati- 
-ons would at last be subject to the jews.

-ship the jews god, and what greater subjection can be
I heard this with some wonder, & must confess 
my own conviction. After dinner I ask'd Isaiah to fa- 
-vour the world with his lost works, he said none of 
equal value was lost. Ezekiel said the same of his.
I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and 
barefoot three years? he answerd, the same that made 
our friend Diogenes the Grecian.

Proverbs of Hell
Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with 
bricks of Religion. 
The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. 
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. 
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. 
The nakedness of woman is the work of God. 
Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps. 
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging 
of the stormy sea. and the destructive sword. are 
portions of eternity too great for the eye of man. 
The fox condemns the trap, not himself. 
Joys impregnate, Sorrows bring forth. 
Let man wear the fell of the lion. woman the fleece of 
the sheep. 
The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship. 
The selfish smiling fool. & the sullen frowning fool. shall 
be both thought wise. that they may be a rod. 
What is now proved was once, only imagin'd. 
The rat, the mouse. the fox, the rabbet; watch the roots, 
the lion, the tyger. the horse. the elephant, watch 
the fruits, 
The cistern contains; the fountain overflows 
One thought, fills immensity. 
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man
